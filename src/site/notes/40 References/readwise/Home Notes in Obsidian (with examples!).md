>The simplest home note in Obsidian is a list of links, and that’s all it is. It’s a “table of contents”-like structure that gives an idea of the contents of this vault. My first home note looked like this:
>• [[Inbox\|Inbox]]
>• [[Faith MOC\|Faith MOC]]
>• [[20 Mocs/People\|People]]
>• [[Projects MOC\|Projects MOC]]
