>Thousands of emails. Hundreds of files. File structures created on a whim and six layers deep. Duplicated content, lost content. **We thought search would save us from this nightmare, but we were wrong.** ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvjs9n3av56fkv4avqm0v9))


>Step 1: Divide everything in to ten things ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvk0t8pg23z7qb2a7h12g3))


>• Take everything you need to organise and sort it in to, at most, ten large buckets.
>• Make sure the buckets are unambiguously different.
>• Put a label on each bucket. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvk3ysr9m19ycw9f0jq7rx))


>**We call these buckets your areas.** An area might be `Finance`. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvk752tbph3p2b9awnmxm4))


>Step 2: In each area, divide in ten again ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvkaqbjptebsmhy2nrk318))


>A category within the `Finance` area might be `Tax Returns`. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvkcm8hdypjgg17s2vn53p))


>We give each category a number ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvkx1h4yp1w4b0cbdbqqpv))


>Let’s say `10-19` is our `Finance` area. Category `11` might be `Tax returns`, `12 Payroll`, and so on. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvm18yvhtgj1d633qp2kjy))


>A Johnny.Decimal number looks like this:
>They’re short, memorable, and can be spoken out loud. **They’re always two digits, a decimal point, and two more digits.**
>Say it like “forty-two eighteen” or “twelve dot oh-three”. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvkrxp2gtpfaychp7b3evk))


>The number after the decimal is just a counter. **We call it the ID:** it starts at `.01` and increases with each thing you create. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvm9e8hceqrcsnkr0pa0pm))


>The 3rd thing you’ve saved in your `12 Payroll` category might be `12.03 Payroll schedule 2018`. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvmdc0evrmnyxvqk127w34))


>“Hey Kristy, where can I find the payroll schedule?” 
>“Twelve dot oh-three.”
>Thanks, Kristy. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvmrkhw0547xrkyhy8v028))
