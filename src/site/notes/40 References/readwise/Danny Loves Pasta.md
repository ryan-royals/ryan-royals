## Highlights
1. Combine the flours in a pile on a flat work surface or in a large bowl. Make a deep well in the middle.
2. Crack the eggs into the well and use a fork to scramble them. Pull in a little bit of flour from the bottom of the well and mix it with the eggs until most of the lumps are gone.
3. Drag in flour from the edges of your well and incorporate with the Keep incorporating more and more of the flour and eggs until the mixture becomes difficult to stir with a fork.
4. Using a dough scraper, a spatula, or your hands, continue combining the flour with the eggs until no liquid remains. Use your hands to bring the dough together into a loose ball.
5. If the dough is very crumbly and doesn't come together, add a spoonful of water. If it's very slimy, incorporate a spoonful of 00 flour. You may need to do this several times to get it right-most of the dough should be coming together into a ball, but it shouldn't be sticking to your hands at this point.
6. Remove any remaining bits of flour stuck to your work surface or hands and knead the dough for about 5 minutes, until the texture starts to change and becomes smooth.
7. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover with an airtight bowl and let rest for 10 minutes. Then knead again for about 3 minutes, until you have a fairly smooth ball.
8. Cover or wrap the dough again and let rest for at least 1 hour. (Page 38)

4 large eggs (Page 38)

Classic Pasta Dough

1. Cut the dough into quarters and work with one piece at a time, leaving the rest covered so it doesn't dry out. Roll the dough to the second- or thirdthinnest setting on your pasta machine, or about 1 millimeter thick if rolling by hand.
2. Lightly dust your work surface with flour and lay the pasta sheet down horizontally. Use a sharp knife or pastry roller to cut the sheet into long horizontal strips measuring 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Make diagonal cuts in each strip to create equilateral triangles with sides about 2½ inches (6 cm) long.
3. Cover the triangles with a bowl or kitchen towel so they don't dry out, and work with one piece at a time.
4. Lay a triangle flat in front of you, with one of the sides facing toward you and a point facing away from you. Place a small dowel onto the pasta from the center of the triangle through the middle of the side facing you. The dowel should be pointed toward you.
5. Lift the top tip of the triangle and bend it toward you so it sits flat on the dowel.
6. Holding the tip in place on the dowel, pick up the right tip of the triangle.
Bend it toward the center of the triangle so it rests directly on the first tip.
Then do the same for the last tip, pressing down so the three tips stick to each other (see Tip).
7. Gently slide the dowel out of the pasta; it should keep its shape.
8. Rest the pasta on a floured surface or piece of parchment paper. Continue with the rest of the dough.
9. Cook the pasta in salted, boiling water until tender, 2 to 5 minutes. (Page 111)

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Slice the squash in half vertically (see Tip). Scoop out the seeds, then place both squash halves, cut side up, on the baking sheet. Add the shallots to the baking sheet.
3. Drizzle the squash and shallots with oil, then rub the oil into the squash to cover the entire surface. Sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper.
4. Slice off the top of the head of garlic, about ½ inch (1 cm) from the end, to expose all the cloves. Drizzle with oil, then sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Wrap the garlic in aluminum foil and place it on the baking sheet.
5. Cook the vegetables for 35 to 40 minutes, until the squash is tender enough to pierce easily with a fork. Remove and let cool.
6. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook your pasta according to recipe or package directions. Drain and set aside.
7. Scoop the flesh of the squash into a food processor. Add the shallots and garlic cloves (squeeze the garlic head to remove them).
8. Add the nutmeg, then puree the vegetables until smooth. Taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary.
9. Pour the puree into a saucepan, then add the heavy cream. Heat on medium-low until the sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes, and then add to the pasta. (Page 199)
