## Highlights
This tutorial shows you how to deploy an Azure Route Server into a virtual network and establish a BGP peering connection with a Quagga network virtual appliance (NVA). You deploy a virtual network with four subnets. One subnet is dedicated to the Route Server and another subnet dedicated to the Quagga NVA. The Quagga NVA will be configured to exchange routes with the Route Server. Lastly, you'll test to make sure routes are properly exchanged on the Route Server and Quagga NVA.
