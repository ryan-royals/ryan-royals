## Highlights
Output HCL instead of Terraform JSON
CDKTF synth now supports HCL as an output, in addition to the Terraform JSON which was previously supported. This makes it easier to debug the configuration that CDKTF creates, as HCL output is easier for people to read.
Moreover, this means you can use CDKTF as a templating engine to generate a Terraform config that will then be used and edited by other teams. Finally, it means you can now use CDKTF with tooling that supports only Terraform HCL. Although Terraform Cloudâ€™s native features, like policy evaluation and health assessments, work with JSON, other common tools, like code scanners and linters, support only HCL.
