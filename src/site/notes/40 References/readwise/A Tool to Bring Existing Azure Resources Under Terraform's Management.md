>A tool to bring your existing Azure resources under the management of Terraform. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h181cchza6ptb3pj8w4sf47y))


>`aztfexport` imports the resources that are supported by the [Terraform AzureRM provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm) into the Terraform state, and generates the corresponding Terraform configuration. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h181crkev1jvdjmqaxdjh1jr))


>Both the Terraform state and configuration are expected to be consistent with the resources' remote state, i.e., `terraform plan` shows no diff. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h181cy4hs6n5qp6tzayr0str))


>The Terraform configurations generated by `aztfexport` are not meant to be comprehensive and do not ensure that the infrastructure can be fully reproduced from the generated configurations. For details, please refer to the [limitation](https://github.com/Azure/aztfexport#limitation). ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h181d3sekxat4w7ek9n561vs))
