## Summary

In this lesson, we will learn a technique called the positional notation method. The value of each digit in a binary number is determined by its position in the table. The sum of all these column values for each digit gives the decimal representation of the binary number.

>Routers and switches see IP addresses like this:
>110000.10101000.00000001.00101101
>However,Â we humans find it hard to work and remember binary numbers. That is why we work and write IP addresses in decimal representation that looks like this:
>192.168.1.45 ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8mz74wmt7k6zq4c7112qqrs))


>Binary Math
>In this lesson, we will learn a technique called the **positional notation method**. In binary numbers, each successive bit within a group represents a power of two and the values ascend from right to left. Therefore, the rightmost bit represents 20, the second most-right bit represents 21, and so on, as is shown in the table below. Each successive bits on the left represent twice the value. The value of each digit in a binary number is determined by its position in the table. The sum of all these column values for each digit gives the decimal representation of the binary number.
