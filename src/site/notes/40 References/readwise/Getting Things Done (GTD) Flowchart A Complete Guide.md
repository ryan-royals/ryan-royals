>**Main Principles**
>• Break complex projects down into clear and concrete action steps
>• Consolidate all jobs into one system, eliminating unnecessary or ambiguous tasks
>• Set the sequence of tasks ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63e7h7vhz6e9ndtdyb1cdaw))


>**Capture (Collect)**
>In this step, you have to gather all the tasks you need to deal with together. Then, capture all in one place to make sure you do not miss anything. 
>These can be tasks on the daily to-do list, work on a small project, or even long-term plans. In addition, they can also be an email inbox, voicemail, or document at work that you need to handle. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63e87m7gq9wrq123gt932qg))


>**Clarify (Process)**
>This is the clarify phase to answer three questions:
>• **What is it?** : defines the input (tasks, works, plans, projects) to serve as the premise for the classification.
>• **Is it actionable?** : making action decisions by answering YES or NO. There are three reasons you would say NO to the task field: you removed non-actionable items, you do it but not right now, and you want to use it as reference material for later.
>• **What is the next action?** : this is the next question after you say YES to the job you need to do. However, you should immediately do tasks that take less than 2 minutes. For 2-minute tasks, you can choose to defer or delegate them. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63e8fnjr778fvnhdxcq5bcn))


>**Organize (Prioritize)**
>The next thing to do is prioritize and make current action to the larger task that needs more than 2 minutes to finish. Finally, it would be best if you created your folders to organize tasks in groups ea ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63eavrrj3095y0kfy8dsfjw))


>• **One-day-list folder**: the daily tasks to be completed (remember to specify the date)
>• **Pending folder**: the current task you are working on, waiting for feedback, and needing to complete
>• **Urgent folder**: tasks you need to complete as quickly as possible to meet deadlines
>• **Reference folder**: jobs that are not too urgent but you find interesting and can do later ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63eb81x7tqwmf8y59rdr02a))


>**Reflect (Plan)**
>It would help if you determined where you are in your work progress not to fall behind. Accordingly, it would help if you did a weekly review of the priorities to ensure it is reasonable for you to achieve the progression you expected.

>**Engage (Do)**
>Everything will be easy if you go to this step. You only need to perform the list of tasks in the order you set earlier from high to low priority. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h63ec3z6pz4p07ek1qjavhya))
