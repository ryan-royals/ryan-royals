## Highlights Added July 17, 2024 at 11:02 AM

> Border Gateway Protocol is the routing protocol that connects the entire internet ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7s2b1x5w8stknjkpsxjfbpk>))

> Large organizations and most ISPs manage internet connectivity for multiple network sites and locations. This is called an autonomous system, or AS ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7s2e46ep6qfgs7dh2efpsyh>))

> While networks inside an AS handle  
> routing for their own local traffic, a BGP router directs all inbound traffic into the autonomous system, and all outbound traffic going to the internet from inside the AS ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7s2gcw4zaf9gy1dcghnaczf>))

> When a BGP router connects to a router in a neighboring AS, it's called external BGP ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7s2g1ffjptg041xzvckkp3t>))
