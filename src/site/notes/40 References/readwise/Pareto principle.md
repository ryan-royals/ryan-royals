## Summary

The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few").

> The **Pareto principle** states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few").1(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#cite_note-NYT-1>) Other names for this principle are the **80/20 rule**, the **law of the vital few,** or the **principle of factor sparsity.**2(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#cite_note-2>)3(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#cite_note->:0-3) ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01h717xw80y33fwj3n20af4e8k>))

> In computing  
> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) the Pareto principle can be applied to [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(computer_science)) efforts.14(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#cite_note-optimization-14>) For example, [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated.15(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#cite_note-15>) Lowell Arthur expressed that "20% of the code has 80% of the errors. Find them, fix them!"16(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#cite_note-16>) It was also discovered that, in general, 80% of a piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time. This factor is usually a part of [COCOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO) estimating for software coding.
