## Summary

ExpressRoute FastPath improves data path performance by sending network traffic directly to virtual machines, bypassing the gateway. To use FastPath, you need a virtual network gateway and must meet specific configuration requirements. It is important to note that FastPath does not support certain features, such as user-defined routes on the gateway subnet or connections through basic load balancers.
