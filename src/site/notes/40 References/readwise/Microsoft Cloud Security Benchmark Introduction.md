## Summary

The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) helps organizations secure their cloud services by providing best practice recommendations and security controls. It is designed for users new to cloud platforms or those looking to improve their existing security posture, especially in multi-cloud environments. MCSB offers a framework to ensure compliance with industry standards and automates secure configurations.

>The Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) includes a collection of high-impact security recommendations you can use to help secure your cloud services in a single or multi-cloud environment. MCSB recommendations include two key aspects:
>• **Security controls**: These recommendations are generally applicable across your cloud workloads. Each recommendation identifies a list of stakeholders that are typically involved in planning, approval, or implementation of the benchmark.
>• **Service baselines**: These apply the controls to individual cloud services to provide recommendations on that specific service’s security configuration. We currently have service baselines available only for Azure. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9mpwj4qaf00g0r5mb8jj40k))
