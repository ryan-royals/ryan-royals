## Highlights
The Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) includes a collection of high-impact security recommendations you can use to help secure your cloud services in a single or multi-cloud environment. MCSB recommendations include two key aspects:
• **Security controls**: These recommendations are generally applicable across your cloud workloads. Each recommendation identifies a list of stakeholders that are typically involved in planning, approval, or implementation of the benchmark.
