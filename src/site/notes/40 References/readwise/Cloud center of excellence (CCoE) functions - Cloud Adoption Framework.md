A cloud center of excellence (CCoE) is a function that helps organizations balance speed and stability while they pursue this objective. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy9vxqkytwmhfe8q728480jh))


A CCoE model requires collaboration between each of the following resources:
• Cloud adoption (solution architects)
• Cloud strategy (the program and project managers)
• Cloud governance
• Cloud platform
• Cloud automation ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy9vy7nq0ss98xdz9af58ne6))

The objective of the CCoE is to:
• Help build a modern IT organization by using agile approaches to capture and implement business requirements.
• Use reusable deployment packages that align with security, compliance, and management policies.
• Maintain a functional Azure platform in alignment with operational procedures.
• Review and approve the use of cloud-native tools.
• Standardize and automate commonly needed platform components and solutions over time. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01gya5tz2q2rjhq5v1t96hne54))
