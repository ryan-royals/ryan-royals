## Highlights

Microsoft being very careful about is when it's exposing functionality that can actually modify or delete things they want to make sure the right guard rails are in place the right checks the right confirmations are in place so we don't do harm through these natural language interactions so the whole point that these are put in all of the right guard rails
confirmations etc etc around anything ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgvhgjaqfh25cba1ybzp9gq7))


co-pilot cannot do anything you couldn't do already through the portal ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgvhsdt2vt055hg3yza13syx))

enable it at a tenant level and then all of the subscriptions that trust that tenant get it and the answer is no ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgvjad8wce51xzdbwp8sc576))
