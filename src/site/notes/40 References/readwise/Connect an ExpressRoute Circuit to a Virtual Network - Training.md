## Summary

This text provides training on connecting an ExpressRoute circuit to an Azure virtual network. It explains the requirements for creating this connection, including the need for an active circuit and proper peering configurations. Additionally, it covers how to establish secure VPN tunnels over ExpressRoute for encrypted data exchange between on-premises networks and Azure.

## Highlights

You can link up to 10 virtual networks to a standard ExpressRoute circuit. All virtual networks must be in the same geopolitical region when using a standard ExpressRoute circuit. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3bx7bdbrr7xprwpfm7gx6vg))


A single VNet can be linked to up to 16 ExpressRoute circuits. Use the following process to create a new connection object for each ExpressRoute circuit you are connecting to. The ExpressRoute circuits can be in the same subscription, different subscriptions, or a mix of both. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3bx7h7039p6etq7ajb975nz))


If you enable the ExpressRoute premium add-on, you can link virtual networks outside of the geopolitical region of the ExpressRoute circuit. The premium add-on will also allow you to connect more than 10 virtual networks to your ExpressRoute circuit depending on the bandwidth chosen.
