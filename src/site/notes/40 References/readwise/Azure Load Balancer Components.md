Load Balancer rules
A load balancer rule is used to define how incoming traffic is distributed to **all** the instances within the backend pool. A load-balancing rule maps a given frontend IP configuration and port to multiple backend IP addresses and ports. Load Balancer rules are for inbound traffic only.
For example, use a load balancer rule for port 80 to route traffic from your frontend IP to port 80 of your backend instances.
