Are you building a plugin or theme for Obsidian?

Today we're launching our new Developer Documentation: [docs.obsidian.md](https://docs.obsidian.md)

Learn how to get started and how to polish an existing project, using our new resources for developers.

Here are a few of the things you can find in the new docs:

* **Tutorials** for how to get started with plugin and theme development.
* **Reference docs** for both our plugin API and CSS variables
* **Guidelines** for how to publish your project to the Obsidian catalog.

We look forward to hearing what you think, and to continuing to improve the docs with more developer content!

Visit [docs.obsidian.md](https://docs.obsidian.md) to get started.
