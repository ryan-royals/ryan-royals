Azure Verified Modules provides two types of modules: Resource and Pattern modules.

AVM modules are used to deploy Azure resources and their extensions, as well as reusable architectural patterns consistently.

Modules are composable building blocks that encapsulate groups of resources dedicated to one task.

* Flexible, generalized, multi-purpose
* Integrates child resources
* Integrates extension resources

AVM improves code quality and provides a unified customer experience.
