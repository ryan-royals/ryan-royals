Terraform Enterprise is HashiCorp's self-hosted distribution of [HCP Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs). Terraform Enterprise offers a private instance of HCP Terraform application, with no resource limits and additional enterprise-grade architectural features like audit logging and SAML single sign-on.

HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise are different distributions of the same application. When this documentation refers to HCP Terraform, the information applies to Terraform Enterprise unless specifically stated otherwise.

Before mid-2019, we referred to all distributions of HCP Terraform as Terraform Enterprise, and the self-hosted distribution as Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE). These older names sometimes appear in supporting tools, like the [`tfe` Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest), which you can also use with HCP Terraform.

#### Deploying Terraform Enterprise

The [installation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/install/pre-install-checklist) and [administration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/application-administration) instructions are for customers who feel confident that they can successfully deploy Terraform Enterprise on their own. If you are unsure, or have questions, please talk to your Solutions Engineer (pre-sales, POC or trial) or Customer Success Manager (existing customers). If you have read the documentation and are ready to schedule your install, please inform your Sales Engineer (pre-sales, POC or trial) or Customer Success Manager (existing customers) of your install time window so they can make sure they are available if necessary.
