AI-assisted coding is more than just hype. But like every powerful tool, knowing how to use GitHub Copilot correctly is key to getting the most out of it. In this session we take a look at how Copilot works, some best practices and what AI can realistically do for developers in the real world. GitHub Copilot will change how you write code; but only if you are curious, creative, and you continue to think critically. AI is only as good as the developer who wields it.

AI captioning languages supported: Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, French Canadian, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese(Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian
