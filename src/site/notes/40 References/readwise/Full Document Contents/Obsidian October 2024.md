October is here, which means only one thing: Obsidian October aka O\_O is here! And this year we‚Äôre making O\_O all about *speed*.

Every year O\_O has introduced developers to the world of making Obsidian plugins. Today, there are nearly 2,000 community-built plugins. We never imagined that the ecosystem would be so rich and expansive.

So this year, we‚Äôre switching things up. We want to encourage the developer community to revisit existing plugins to make them even better.

In the last few months, we have put a major emphasis on app performance while continuing to expand the [plugin API](https://docs.obsidian.md/). We want to see more plugins adopt these new APIs, and focus on creating a snappy experience.

This month you can join Obsidian October in the following ways.

**Sign up for a plugin critique.** If you want to have your plugin critiqued by the Obsidian team, [sign up on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/1290743805708079198).

**Self-assessment.** Follow our checklists to improve your plugin, theme, or vault:

* [Plugin checklist](https://docs.obsidian.md/oo24/plugin)
* [Theme checklist](https://docs.obsidian.md/oo24/theme)
* [Vault checklist](https://docs.obsidian.md/oo24/vault)

**Join new Discord channels** to [showcase your project](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1290740823893344378) and [chat with other participants](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1290741034720039022).

We hope everyone has a great time! üçª
