**Purpose**

This policy outlines Arkahna's commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. Our ESG policy reflects our dedication to conducting business in a sustainable, ethical, and responsible manner, aligning our operations with the highest standards of environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance.

**Environmental Responsibility**

1. **Resource Efficiency:** We strive to minimise our environmental footprint by optimising resource usage, reducing waste, and promoting efficient energy consumption in our operations.
2. **Carbon Neutrality:** Arkahna is committed to reducing its carbon emissions and transitioning towards carbon neutrality. We will actively choose partnerships and supplier relationships with organisations that leverage renewable energy sources, and we will implement strategies to offset our own carbon impact.
3. **Green Practices:** We encourage eco-friendly practices among our employees, contractors, and partners. This includes promoting recycling, reducing paper consumption, and eliminating where possible single-use plastics.

**Social Engagement**

1. **Diversity and Inclusion:** Arkahna is dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that values individuals from all backgrounds. We promote equal opportunities, discourage discrimination, and celebrate the unique perspectives of our team members.
2. **Workplace Health and Safety:** The safety and well-being of our employees are paramount. We maintain a safe and healthy work environment, complying with relevant health and safety regulations to prevent accidents and promote employee welfare. Arkahna is committed to creating a psychologically safe workplace.
3. **Community Support:** We actively engage with local communities through charitable initiatives, volunteering, and partnerships that address social challenges and contribute positively to the areas where we operate.

**Governance Excellence**

1. **Ethical Conduct:** We uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all our business dealings. Our employees and stakeholders are expected to adhere to ethical practices and act in the best interests of Arkahna and its partners.
2. **Transparency and Accountability:** Arkahna is committed to transparent communication with stakeholders. We provide accurate and timely information about our ESG efforts, financial performance, and strategic decisions.
3. **Board Oversight:** Our board of directors oversees our ESG initiatives, ensuring that sustainability, social responsibility, and governance considerations are integrated into our strategic decisions and business operations.

**Planned Continuous Improvement**

1. **Metrics and Reporting:** We aim to regularly measure and report our progress in achieving ESG goals, demonstrating our commitment to transparency and accountability to our stakeholders.
2. **Stakeholder Engagement:** We will be actively engaging with our stakeholders, including employees, clients, investors, and communities, to gather feedback, address concerns, and incorporate diverse perspectives into our ESG initiatives.
3. **Adaptation and Innovation:** Arkahna remains agile in adapting to evolving ESG challenges and opportunities. We encourage innovation in sustainable practices and seek new ways to align our business with global ESG best practices.

**Compliance and Enforcement**

While this policy is a statement of intentions, deliberate non-compliance may result in disciplinary actions, including but not limited to warnings, training, and termination of employment or business relationships. All employees, contractors, and partners are expected to adhere to this policy and contribute to the collective effort to uphold Arkahnaâ€™s ESG principles.

By adhering to this ESG policy, Arkahna demonstrates its unwavering commitment to sustainable practices, ethical conduct, and responsible governance, contributing positively to the well-being of our planet, society, and business operations.
