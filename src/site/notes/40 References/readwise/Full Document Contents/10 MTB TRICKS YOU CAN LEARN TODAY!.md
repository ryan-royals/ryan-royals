hello everyone today is going to be epic because I'm out here in Venice Beach California and I'm going to be showing you 10 different tricks that you can learn on your mountain bike the second this video stops so let's get into it with number one [Music] so the first trick I'm going to be showing you today is the pedal hop it's very useful super cool and it looks like this there we go simple pedal hop 

so to get started with this trick you're going to need to know how to wheelie first obviously here's a quick reminder you want to pull up arms straight and just pedal like that let me do it from the side again just to show you so pedal lean back straight arms so how's that going to help you well once you've got the wheelie dialed I want you to do a stood up wheelie like that using your brake so the next step to learning the pedal hop is to just do a normal wheelie and then just stop every now and then 

using your brake and that gives you the feeling of Wheeling stopping empowering then what you do next is each time you stop and pedal you hop as you can see from that slow-mo there once again it's push while your leg hits the end of the stroke that you want to make you can pull up like you would on a normal hop and obviously just 

as you start to Pedal you let go of the break and that's going to bring you forward of course you're going to want to be in a bit of a lower gear so it's going to be easier to maneuver the bike on the back wheel so once you've learned it you can do cool little additional things in the streets like this and then that just makes stuff a lot more fun so we can do different Maneuvers up to back here and then just pedal hop across whatever we want look 

so fun opening up a whole new world of excitement and quite seemingly boring features on to the next one number two this is a super good fun one this is the X up Rider super simple looks nuts to people that don't particularly know about biking and it's super fun to do if you do know about biking all we're gonna do is an X up and then riding around like this for that the best thing to do is to clamp 

your knees pull up spin them you've got to commit or you're going to die and there we go the x-up rider well good on to the next number three is the bar spin you're gonna need some bike modifications though as you can see I'm on my Enduro bike but it doesn't have a front brake and my gears are mounted here if you want to try it please make sure you have long enough cables or it's not going to spin the whole way for the beginning of this trick you're going to need to know how to lift the front up 

easy you just done the ax up Rider so you're going to be able to do that then you've got to know to clamp your knees on the seat I did tell you that in the X up Rider as well we're going to pull up clamp our knees throw the bar you can do it back the other way too but the beauty of this is the more you do that that is literally the exact way you want to do it on a jump so it's good practice for that basically on a jump you're going to take off clamp your knees and throw so by doing this on 

the flat ground you can have that basic skill wired into your brain and it's definitely going to help a lot also as we're talking about the bar spin you can do the classic upside down if you clamp your knees and on your back you can learn how the bar spin works you see if you're scared of the bunny hot bath spin you can still use this for Street moves look so for example without the Bunny Hop you can still do bar spins out in the streets by pulling up with that technique off of 

things and of course you want to go to the next level you can do it like this that was a proper hot bar spin where you pull up get to a good height clamp your knees and throw it that's the bar spin super fun trick go learn it on to number four this is one of my favorite flat ground crowd Pleasers so that was a pirouette it's a bit 

easier of a front brakes you can push off of the front wheel obviously I don't have that so you want to get your weight to one side and like pre-load it up as if you're going to do a 360 and then with your weight on the back wheel you keep on the brake and it's just a matter of getting further and further round so I suggest you just start by doing small ones here here try and get it more and more more 

more more more more then once you're comfy do the full send all the way around and literally everyone around you will lose their minds look how sick this is you ready he went wild number five this is the fakie wool ride now it's very difficult from flat ground but first I want you to learn how to Fakie so for this as we're 

doing it against the wall you can ride up to it on your with your front wheel hit the wall push off a bit and as you see I'm riding backwards you have to Pedal backwards to allow the wheel to work because if you don't obviously it's just going to lock up like this and you won't go anywhere but the fakie wall ride gets very difficult I want you to do a normal wall ride first easy the fakie ball is terrifying you've got a jump up like this and get back 

before slamming yourself into the floor and it looks like this thank you as you can see here in this slow motion you come towards the wall uh about walking pace you want to compress as hard as possible to get as much rebound out of the shocks as possible pull up push your back and front wheel hard into the wall the harder you push them into the wall the more committed you are and you can be able to pull back out of the wall easily to get your wheel down and 

fake you out if you half commit to it your back wheel is going to hit into the floor and you'll fall backwards if you're a bit nervous you can go slightly sideways for the first few goes and slowly get your angle up to 12 o'clock this is like the OG maneuver in the street when it comes to wall rides go and have some fun let's get on to the next one one number six this is super fun you can use it on trails in the streets on any bike this is a nose Bonk 

looks like this as you can see there that's the nose Bond it's a super fun addition to just riding around you can make seemingly normal things way more exciting just to really get a feeling for it try if you can do that on the floor while you're riding along so you just transfer your weight to the front and once you push down on the front wheel you can like push off of it and then obviously once you add it with a bit of 

speed that's when you can then drop the front wheel on stuff number seven this is STEEZ for that I mean adding STEEZ to Jumping normal jumps are sick getting air on a mountain bike is amazing but when they look like this it's just not that exciting so if you just add a little bit of a turn into your bar like that you're going to make such a huge difference so there were two different variations on the first one I turned my bar away from the way I was 

jumping and the next one into it but you have to remember if you want to be steezy you can't have your legs apart because I'll do it again with the legs apart and it sort of changes the whole look of the maneuver it's crazy just such a small little simple thing putting your knees closer together just transforms it so once again just so you can see the comparison now of course that air time is super small but I just wanted to show you that you can add 

STEEZ anywhere so that's how simple it is to look more stylish on a bike get those knees together turn your bars even just slightly it's going to look way cooler than just jumping in a dead Straight Scared looking way if you can get a bit of a movement on the bike there knees together you're going to look much more in control and it's going to look way more delightful to watch when you look back at the clips number eight this is the foot jam clock work you're going to need to know how to foot jam already 

that's where you wedge your front wheel in the fork like that with your tire and your toes on the crown then if you want to do the Clockwork version this is when you spin on the front wheel while doing it like this you've got to get the balance right and you can turn off of the front wheel to get yourself spinning 

as you can see in the slow-mo there was those slight actuations with the shoulder that allow the spin to happen as well as the turning at the beginning see simple get your Clockwork on hey this is the Russian slider I may have shown this in the past but this is an ultimate flat land trick I absolutely love it what you're going to need to know is how to 180 on flat first like this 

once you've got your 180 landed you've got a land with your wheel sideways so when you start going back you've got a pedal with your wheel like that and slowly it will bring the front background [Applause] Russian slider now it's only joking just so it look difficult you do this 

see that you get that cool slidiness to it which feels so awesome hot 180 laundry bars sideways let it slide out and a little tip for you is to go up into a higher gear so when you're going backwards you don't have to Pedal as hard which means you can go further with less backwards pedal which means the slide is going to be thicker and longer onto the finale this is the final one of today and any one of you can do 

this maneuver it's such a fun one and if you can get into it whilst rolling facing the correct direction then you get bonus points switch onto the seat like that maybe this that look at that oh my goodness let's get a bit of speed up then oh my God it's so gnarly at speed sorry guys back seat burying back it back it today were my 10 tricks you can 

do on a mountain bike anywhere they're super fun puts a smile on your face and gets you outside so on that bombshell of fun that is the end of the video see in the next one [Laughter] hmm
