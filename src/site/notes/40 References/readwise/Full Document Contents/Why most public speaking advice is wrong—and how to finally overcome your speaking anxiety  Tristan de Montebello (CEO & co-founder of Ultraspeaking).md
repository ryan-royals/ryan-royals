**Some takeaways:**

1. To get better at public speaking, enjoyment is key. If it doesn’t feel enjoyable, you’re probably doing it wrong. Try to approach each speaking opportunity as a chance to share something meaningful rather than as a chore.
2. Don’t just study public speaking; actually do it! Join or create a game-based practice group to make speaking fun and less intimidating. The more you practice in a low-stakes, enjoyable environment, the more confident and skilled you’ll become. Think of this as training for a sport—show up, play, and improve.
3. Start recognizing the immense potential of your subconscious. Trust that your brain can fill in the gaps. Begin by completing prompts with just a few words to kick-start your thought process. For example, write down the beginning of a sentence that reflects your goals and see where your mind takes you.
4. Practical tips to appear more confident:

	1. **Think up:** When gathering your thoughts, resist the urge to look down. Instead, practice looking up and maintaining eye contact with your audience. This simple shift will not only make you appear more confident but will also help you think more clearly. Put a sticky note with “Think Up” on your computer as a reminder.
	2. **End strong:** People often taper off or express uncertainty at the end of sentences or presentations, which leaves a bad impression. Anticipate this and practice ending your statements confidently with phrases like “In summary” or “To wrap up.”
	3. **Stay in character:** When you are getting flustered or feeling uncertain, resist the temptation to acknowledge it verbally or through your body-language. Remember that as a speaker, you’re the train conductor. Stay focused on your message and the journey ahead. If something goes wrong, don’t stop to acknowledge it; just keep moving forward. The audience will usually follow your lead and won’t dwell on minor hiccups.
5. Ultraspeaking uses game-based exercises to create “turbulence” and push speakers out of their comfort zones in a low-stakes environment. When you treat speaking as a game, you’ll find it easier to let go of your perfectionism.
