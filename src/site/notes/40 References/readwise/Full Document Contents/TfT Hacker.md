This is a cool experiment and many are using it, though I never intended for anyone to use it. I built it for myself.

#### Info on the experiment.

My problem with highlights from [Readwise](https://bit.ly/rwreader) is that I have MANY of them. So I wanted some GTD like "inbox" to "processed" workflow.

With this tool, the "Readwise Inbox", you can see an "inbox" of unprocessed highlights from [Readwise](https://bit.ly/rwreader). You process each highlights one at a time until they are done.

You can skip a highlight, copy a highlight and do a few other useful things with them.

1/ I am prototyping a tool for [@obsdmd](https://twitter.com/obsdmd) and [@readwiseio](https://twitter.com/Readwiseio). I gave it the code name: Readwise Inbox. It is grabbing all my unprocessed highlights, exported to Obsidian. I can read the highlight, get a block reference to the highlight for insertion into other notes.
