#### Driving innovation in healthcare with AI

[Novo Nordisk](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1822396525953324537-novo-azure-openai-service-health-provider-en-denmark) has been a leader in global healthcare for nearly a century, committed to improving the lives of patients with chronic conditions. However, developing high-quality medicine is a resource-intensive endeavor that requires collaboration across Novo Nordisk. To scale a pipeline of drug discovery, development, and data science capabilities, Novo Nordisk has leaned into its culture of innovation to bring forward the next generation of medicine with the help of [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai).

Novo Nordisk is leveraging AI and machine learning to accelerate drug discovery. By applying advanced AI models in the cloud, life scientists, and computational biologists can analyze large volumes of clinical trial data and research findings to accelerate the development of new treatments. Together, Novo Nordisk and Microsoft Research have even [developed an algorithm](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.12.24301213v1) that can detect cardiovascular risk in patients better than the best clinical standards.

This innovative approach doesn’t just make a difference for individual patients—it has the potential to reshape the entire field of healthcare. By using AI to accelerate the development of life-changing treatments and deliver more tailored care, Novo Nordisk is setting a new standard for what is possible when human curiosity and technology coalesce. 

#### Building a future of accelerated scientific discovery in consumer goods

As one of the world’s largest consumer goods companies, Unilever is known for its quality brands including Dove, TRESemmé, Omo, Degree, Hellmann’s, and Ben & Jerry’s. Whether it be cleaning, beauty, or other consumer products, each area requires the latest scientific breakthroughs to improve products that over 3.4 billion people use daily. Now, they are leveraging cloud-based simulations to enhance their laboratory experiments.

Unilever can query scientific information using natural language, performing thousands of computational simulations in the time it would take to run tens of laboratory experiments. Unilever scientists can then use the data gathered from these simulations to fine-tune models that screen tens of thousands of materials or enable the exploration of intricate chemical reactions at substantial speed. 

This pursuit of innovation has been part of a larger [transformative journey](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1636966914474684948-unilever-consumer-goods-sap-on-azure) that includes one of the [largest cloud migrations](https://news.microsoft.com/2023/04/02/unilever-goes-cloud-only-accenture-and-microsoft-complete-one-of-the-largest-cloud-migrations-in-consumer-goods-industry/) in the consumer goods industry. Unilever’s story shows that with the right technology, scientific discovery can be accelerated, helping to bring better products to consumers around the world.

#### Enhancing customer experience through an adaptive cloud approach in retail

In the world of retail, staying ahead means delivering experiences that resonate with customers—something [Coles Supermarkets](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-au/story/1769790334604179311-coles-group-azure-machine-learning-retailers-en-australia) understands well. As one of Australia’s largest retail chains, Coles is constantly looking for ways to better serve its customers while running its growing technology landscape more efficiently. A key part of their strategy has been adopting an adaptive cloud approach, which allows them to innovate in the cloud while maintaining the stability and control of their existing on-premises environment.

This hybrid infrastructure enables Coles to leverage the best of both worlds. They can continue using their on-premises systems for critical workloads while gaining the agility and scalability of the cloud for advanced data analysis and innovation. By analyzing purchasing patterns through cloud-based data insights, they can tailor promotions and recommendations that meet individual needs, creating a more personalized shopping experience for their customers. 

At the same time, the flexibility of the cloud helps Coles streamline their supply chain operations, ensuring that products are available when and where customers need them. This adaptive approach allows them to respond quickly to changes in demand, keeping shelves stocked and customers satisfied, even during peak periods. 

Coles’ hybrid strategy highlights the importance of flexibility in modern retail. It shows how retailers can use a combination of cloud and on-premises capabilities not just to improve operational efficiency, but to build lasting relationships with their customers. In a competitive market, this ability to adapt and innovate while maintaining a solid foundation is key to building loyalty and trust. 

#### Optimizing operations and customer satisfaction in travel and transport

The travel industry has faced unprecedented challenges in recent years, making operational efficiency more critical than ever. For [Swiss International Airlines](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1799824484108434730-swiss-azure-travel-and-transportation-en-switzerland) (SWISS), one of Europe’s leading airlines, this meant finding ways to adapt quickly while maintaining the highest standards of customer service. On top of these industry challenges, SWISS was faced with end-of-life support for their two costly on-premises datacenters. A key part of their strategy was to modernize their infrastructure, using cloud technology to integrate and streamline their operations. 

By moving critical systems to the cloud, SWISS has been able to improve coordination across scheduling, and logistics creating a more unified and agile approach to their operations. This integration allows them to respond quickly to changes, whether it’s adjusting flight schedules or optimizing resources during peak travel times. The flexibility provided by their cloud environment ensures that they can deliver a seamless experience to passengers, even in the face of disruptions. 

Beyond improving operational efficiency, this approach has also enabled SWISS to maintain a strong focus on the customer experience. By integrating data from various touchpoints, they can better understand and anticipate passenger needs, offering a more personalized and reliable service. This makes it possible for the airline to adapt swiftly to changing customer expectations and deliver the smooth, dependable experiences that travelers value. 

SWISS journey illustrates how cloud technology can be a catalyst for resilience and growth, even in a highly dynamic industry. By embracing digital tools and leveraging data insights, they’ve been able to navigate change, improve efficiency, and continue to meet the evolving needs of their customers. Their story serves as a powerful example of how innovation in data and technology can help companies adapt and thrive, even in the face of uncertainty.
