well greetings YouTube Alan Lube backit's been a whileum just something's been going on I youknow wasn't gonna participate inBaltimore so I wasn't able to get outmuch content recently but I have a spicynew video for You featuring Tao Tao Chuand his Missouri deck that he brought tothe PT Baltimore and so uh yeah wouldyou like to introduce yourself to hotelat all yeah I think uh thanks for havingme back on I'm TaoTao I brought thisdeck to um Baltimore this past weekend

and I did pretty well with it MCC goingfive and one until I got disqualifiedfrom the tournamentyeah so well first of all thanks forcoming on you are still the most viewedvideo on my channel by a large marginbut uh yeah let's uh let's talk aboutthe disqualification why don't youexplain what happened there yeah so umI'll go over it uh a bit in more detailwhen we when I get like a tournamentreport laterum but basically like uh in round sevenof the which was the third round ofdraft

um I uh make a like an illegal play oncamera whereum I like I pitch a card and theninstead of putting it on the at the endof the return instead of putting thecard on the bottom of the deck aseveryone knows you're supposed to do Ijust have this massive brain fart and Iput it on top and that ends up giving melike a numerical advantage in that uhgame and uh so you know illegal play uhgetting getting unfair Advantage uh thatwas uh that was enough for adisqualification at a professional REOso yeahunfortunate situation but I mean ithappens but yeah so let's let's get

right into the deck first of all let'sstart why Azuri like why what makes youwhat made you want to play this day inthe first place okay soum I played Arachne uh in uh allthroughout all of Dynasty season Ireally love that deckum the the way that Iraqis cardpool wasbuilt uh at that time uh there wasn'tmuch in the way of like aggressiveoptions so I I felt likeum it was kind of pigeonholed into beinga fatigue style deck where you could usethe like the the contracts to banish

cards from the topum and then use the ability to sort ofmanipulate the opponent's top deck andeventually maybe deplete their entiredeckumso I I did have a little bit ofcompetitive competitive success with itum but it was it was still clear prettyclear to me that the cardpool was justnot there because they would only haveessentially like a one set onesupplemental set worth of uh support interms of cardpool uh so then Outsidersgets announced with uh assassins being amain feature soum I'll figure well uh assassin's gonna

get more cards and maybe they're gonnabe a lot more Revival in The Wider metaum and when Missouri got announced uh Iwas a bit apprehensive at first becauseum arachne's hero ability is really areally soft power in a game where youwhere every player draws four cards aturn being able to manipulate uh onecard off the top of the opponent's deckis just a really soft power you alsodon't get to play a contract everysingle turn and um maybe if you can like

um you know train together go again uhthrough your boots or um through like arazor reflex or something you canoccasionally get two contracts in a turnbut that's that's pretty rareand the like the the deck doesn't lenditself to uh going on like making widechains uh being aggressive in thatmanner so uh you on average you're gonnaget less than one like a fate sealeffect per turn uh and even then likethe the most powerful thing you can dowith it probably is bottoming a powerfulcard like a channel Matt heroic

um and that's maybe a decent number ofpoints a value uh that sort of thing isit's hard to quantifyum you're often just as likely to getyour opponent closer to a good card asyou are to like uh you can move themaway from a good card so uh in terms oflike the you know the raw value of a ahero power if you look at a hero likeDash you automatically start with likeplus one action point and two tworesource pointsum look at isolator you get like oneaction point plus uh uh one resource

Point uh per turn in terms of like afrost uh frostbite denying your opponentof resourceum Phi you get like one damage a turnand maybe more because you get longerchain links and uh tiger Fukoso all these hero abilities are just uhjust putting points on the boardum so I was my my concerns were that uheven before azuri's ability got revealedthatum if uh Azuri has a power that'sum that does something numericallystrong then she would just be a an

almost strictly better upgrade toArachne because iraqni's uh hero abilityis just a so so such a soft powerumthe the other way that Heroes candistinguish themselves is throughspecialization cards but arachni's onlyspecialization cardum is a one-up in a deck and it's alsojust a complete joke of a cardum regicide is never going to land inthe way you want it you wait the way youwant it to right when I was playingArachneum I often said that last-ditch effortwas the real righteous side like thatwas the actual endgame finisher if you

wanted somebody at the very end of agameum so if Zuri has like some sort of goodability then she'll just be better thanher acne and well unfortunately that'sthat's exactly what happened is where hegets her ability um it doesn't likereally let you cheat resources unlessyou put a red on the bottom which likethe red line version of this uh of thisdeck that Ben Dodd uh madeum does that sort of thingum but uh in this version of the deck atleast most of your stealth cards areblue uh and maybe yellow so you're not

really cheating resources butum having that very powerful hiddeninformation game uh gets uh it'sinefficient blocking out of youropponent like if you present a backstabthat can't be defense reacted to andthenum they don't block six and then youflip into a CNC uh that also can't bedefense reacted to then the defensereaction they were holding in theirArsenal is just like just useless andyou can blow up uh whereas if you justlike pitch the backstab for a CNC thenthey can very straight up just blockwith a two non-d-rex from their hand yep

so that's just like one of them manyplays that you can do with Zuri and alsolike if you don't have something good toflip into sometimes your opponentdoesn't want to risk having something amassive disruption so like you flip intolike a you knowum a plunder the polar for four damageand maybe you leak one damage or maybethey over block it and then you're veryhappy because you essentially got twocars out for your for your appointmentbeforeum that makes sense the other way thatum azuri's uh ability is extremely

powerful for fatigue style strategiesand uh in particular is thatum before if you wanted to swing with abig attack like a like a CNC and you areblocking out a lot you would have todraw the the the CNC first put in YourArsenal and then block with anotherthree cards and then you know pitch acard for the CNC on a following turnslike in a two turn cycle you'd have toArsenal the power card and then on thenext turn you pitch one card for thepower cardum Missouri however lets you uh Arsenaleither half of the the the card or the

pitch you can Arsenal theum the a stealth card like if your handthree stealth cards and a shred andthey're all like one power that's athat's a fine hand because you can blockthree cards Your Arsenal a stealth cardand the next turn you isolate fromArsenal and then you can flip intosomething powerful so um this just letsyou it gives you like way moreflexibility in just being able to blockout with uh multiple cards on every turncycle and still threaten very largeattacks whereas if you wanted to likehold two cars in hand so you can pitchone for to play a power card then youonly get the block with two cards and

that's a lot worse than blocking withthree cards uh soum just grinding out that edge uh is umis just amazingly powerfulum and that unfortunately means thatjust Arachne falls to the Wayside I hopein the future they can print some reallynice specialization cards for himum that uh will make his uh uh make himmore relevant make his ability morerelevant but until then I don't see likea competitively uh viable reason to playany assassin other than usury so that'sthat's kind of what we landed on yeah I

feel like Arachne has like a lot offlavor but he's definitely lacking andhe's so cool dude yeah he's like uh thathump on his shoulder and like the TheMask yeah that's what what an awesomehero I feel like unfortunately yeah herewe are I I feel like maybe in the futureif another hero gets the starvotreatment like way way down maybeArachne will get it but we'll see yeahIraqi uh I don't know spider of the showor something yeah so this deck isdefinitely more lending to a fatiguestyle slash more grindy game plan than

the red line is yeah definitely so uh solike early on in the uh The Outsiders umtournaments rightum Redline was pretty much the onlything that put up any sort of resultswhere you run a lot of Reds with a lotof like reference Rebels um nimbalismstuff that like have uh goken or sudo goagain uh to juice out the amount ofattacks you can do and while stillhaving that disruption of being able toflip a flip a stealth intoum into a six power cardum I I personally do not enjoy playingthat style um I have not even play

tested it because uh I I figured thatthat's not what I wanted to be doingum I very much enjoy my old acne deck soI figured let's try just importing asmuch of it as possible uh into uh intoAzuri and trying to try and tweak ituntil it works and what I pretty quicklyfound out is thatum even if you're playing a very fatigueheavy play style like I still have youknow seven defense reactions in the inthe main board like three sinks threepercent and an inertia up uh and likeyou're still running like sigils but thedeck has gotten so many uh good cards

from Outsiders that uh even while you'replaying that play style it's uh most ofthe time you're actually going to bekilling your opponents through damageum and like uh they're you're not goingto be fully depleting their deck butit's rather that they're going to be onsecond cycle and then they're going tobe attacking with blues and their deckgets weaker and weaker and weaker wellwhereas you are just like your deckactually gets stronger as the game goeson because um all these like useless uhum like six power attacks like Amnesiathat don't really do anything uh in theearly game like suddenly six hour like

it might be enough to kill your opponentand if you're coming in with like a likea surgicalum uh in the late game um that's like aforce two heart block because they'reprobably out of D reacts so uh it's justlike a relative to almost every deck inthe fieldum just gets stronger as the as the gamegoes on so that's why you still want toplay for that sort of long game so eventhough you're not fully depleting youropponent's deck you're still uh you knowtheir their deck is getting fatiguedstill just because it's getting weakerand weakerand another thing about this deck thatyou might have noticed is that there are

a lot of uh two cost six power attacksyeah this is uh interesting so this isuh because of uh dromai my previousstrategy was with Arachne was that umyou just lose yeah what's the Stratright and uh I figured that like goinginto like the the pro tourum I would not be able toto carry that strategy ironically enoughI did not play against a single throw myuh at the pro tour but um I figured itwould be a pretty decent chunk of thefield and so my thought was well howmanyum how many poppers can I squeeze into

this deck without like completelyruining the structural Integrity rightuh and it turns out the answer is likesomewhere around 12. uh because I havethree shakedowns and three command andconquers which are just great cars thatyou would include in every deck I alsohave like three nourishing two amnes anda death touch so um that coupled withthree remembrances in the sideboard uhmeans you have effectively 21 poppersum which sometimes it still is notenoughum against some of the big dragon decksbut like it gives you a lot more passivedefense against uh being able to to stop

dromai from just wrecking you with abunch of dragons in a rowand by the time you have like a 12 uh uhin the in the main you're much morelikely to haveum one or more poppers uh in like atleast uh you know every other hand whichmakes the the defense much easiermakes sense um so why so why the why didI choose the ones I did so okay CNC andShakedown are obvious right obviously umAmnesia okay okay so here's here are myuh so here are my requirements for uh

these poppers so it has to be a popperrightum it needs to have uh it needs to havesix power that's obviousum it needs to have two or less costbecause uh you do need to be able tolike so bluffing uh bluffing with a likean isolate uh is not a good idea if youdon't have something to flip intoum it very rarely like gives you theresults you want like if your opponent'sbad maybe they like block three uh andthen like you and then you know if youhave a good car you flip into six and

they like they can't do reacting againstthem and they loseum but if theum if they were like if they're goodthey're either going to be like preparedto overblock into it or they're gonnaum just like you know take it and hopeyou don't have it and if you're flippinginto something like Amnesia in the earlygame uh if you're not against katsu likeuh the on hit effect that just doesnothing yeah um souh the my but in the late game it's sixdamage and I guess a lot of decks that'sa lot uh when when they're trying to youknow keep you from from killing them

because their their deck is gettingweaker and weaker uh and my lastrequirement was for it to have freeBlock uh you notice there's only onedeath touch in the deck despite thattouching incredibly powerful if thattouch had three block and uh you knowmaybe as like compensation yeah maybe ithas conversation we could drop the theranger class from from the attack youknow they're just being assassin attackwith three block then I think it wouldbe balanced yeah you know uh of courseLS has hire mebut that touch even though the the onhit is uh is very powerfulum and like the the fact that it can

only be like Play for Marshall it's notreally a big deal on this deck uhbecause uh you do have the ability toflip with it um if it Blocks free itwould not matter at all because youwould just walk with it if you get ifyou can't Arsenal it um but the problemis uh it only blocks two and I startedwith like uh start testing with like twodeath touches and uh it was just likenot going well because uh blocking twoum having like a high concentration oftwo blocks in this deck uh is just kindof murder when your opponent's uhnotably the Rangers have like a vastlypowerful on hit effects and they'reoften like the last arrow is a um youknow um Voltaire plus one load a one

cost arrow and come in for six and youneed to block two cards um and deathtouch that does not do that for youum I so I cut it entirely eventuallyum uh pretty late into testing um I putit back inum just because like the the effect isis quite powerful it's not really a codeexcept royalty Target because usually Iprefer leave no Witnesses or CNC um butbeing able to to dump it in the Arsenaluh early on and then coming out uh forlike just a two minute counter so youdon't necessarily need a car from handand that makes it pretty powerful so

it's still in there and of course it's apopper but yeah I definitely didn't wantmore than one I really want to minimizethe the amount of two blocks in thisdeck so uh so I just did a Februarysearch of like uh what what uh twocustomers two costs six power threeblock exactly and the results were uhnursing after this Amnesia and thenwhatever the generic is that has the hasno no actual text uh forget the name ofit yeah brutal alsoum yeah so you know if we needed more ifI had like needed two more it would beanother Amnesia and like a brutalassault uh because that's effectively

all these are so like nurturingemptiness was my was my first choiceover Amnesia um because I figured likeuh Amnesia was only really good againstkatsu and katsu I thought would be asmall enough percentage of the fieldthat um the chance of having nourishingin the opener was like greater than thechance of encountering Katsu now as asurprise uh there actually were a lot ofkatsus at uh at the PT they're actuallylike 20 20 something of them but I wasnot expecting that many so nourishingemptiness was my was my first choiceum when I was like loading up on poppersI started with like you know twonourishing and a third nourishing andthen I added some of niches um nursinguh with three of them in like a if

you're running like 64 cards uh in youruh in in your main board you havesomething like a one in six chance of itshowing up in your opener so like onceper tournament uh you're gonna getsomebody with it yeah and then they'rethey're gonna be like tilted from fromturn zero because you're nourishing themso I would be tilted yeah yeah most ofthe time it's a vanilla Super Six whichagain late game is completely fine umone of the other ways that uh this deckkind of goes towards fatigue is bygenerating like a macro card Advantageby presenting uh like a one card attack

that needs to be blocked by two cardsright so like uh you can think of likeleave the windows as this like if theydon't have the D rack then they'llprobably need to block with two cards soyour one card got two of their cards butum two for sixes can do that if theyneed to block it out right if they needto block a two or six with two cards andyou just um pissed hard even though youpitched the card that card goes back inyour deck and in a fatigue Style gameum you're you're essentially getting atwo for one if you look at the you knowthe macro card advantage of the entiredeck so yeah two or sixes are a goodmacroum and uh uh you know traditionally

Guardians are are the kings of thisbecause um they don't need any any cardsfrom their deck to to a nothos or sludgyfor for six um Missouri uh obviouslycan't be quite bad efficient because wedon't have access to the Sledge um butum but she does uh she does have likeother ways of disrupting and getting ridof cards so um so we're at the pointwhere uh you know a single car thattrades for two cards is a it has to bepretty good value sobecause out of I would say all Six

Equipment everything's pretty standardexcept Perdition I would assume thatlike you know crown of providence isjust such a powerful car powerful cardto block lets you cycle Your Arsenalpotentially Five Card hand Etc but yourun Perdition which is right quitesurprising yeah yes so let's uh let'stalk about the equipment so umso the the daggers uh I have a spider'sbite and nurse couple in the main somost decks run attacks um and most decksuh will at least consider running adefense reaction against Missouri

um nurse couple is also by far the mostpowerful with the flick knives are ournew beautifulum legendary arms piece uh flick knivesis great so uh like I was running aglive gauntless in this before but flicknice is really goodum becauseuh when your opponent D reacts you canin response to like before the theoreactresolves you can flick your nervescalpel hit him for one damage triggerthe nurse couple effect and then thed-react will then resolve and have aminus one so if you're coming withleaving the witness is a single one cardhand and they wanna uh one card blockwith a d-react you can just flick yourdagger and you can just like get them

with it once once per game and thatmakes uh flick knives really goodbecause it also blocks for once so likeyou're essentially getting one point ofdamage value from the flick uh one pointof debuff value from the dagger youflicked and then it blocks for one soit's like three points of value exceptthen if you get an on-hit effect withthe witnesses blowing up the Arsenalthat's worth like you know another threeor four points right yeah so uh it'sit's a massive amount of value generatedfrom one arms piece uh and of course inin the event that your opponent uh is inthe very late game and you still haveyour flick knives and you haven'twatched with it yet uh they can only goto two life they can't go to one lifebecause in your foot you're gonna flick

your second dagger and kill them so yepyeah awesome Arts pieceum it pairs really well with Northscalpel in the sideboard I do have oneorbital classyep uh so orbital class is my choiceagainst uh Wizards uh because uhobviously Wizards by far uh the mostcommon card in the deck is a non-techactionum it's uh also what I bring in againstum against Breyer uh because of the bodyon Earth making a lot of their contactactions block for four instead of threeum and they're probably not going to bebringing too many D reacts against youso uh being able to like uh you know

pitch a card for orbital class and thenum and then go in for uh going for likeI leave no Witnesses and they can'tblock it with a single like a uhum this rounds on me or something uhthat makes it that makes it prettypowerful and against Briar also you'reprobably going to be on an ab2 plan withan Arcane Lantern so you're only gonnahave the one dagger and I think Oracleclass is the best one in that caseum I'd also bring again again story soone notable exclusion from this deck isuhyeah the one that makes the armor uh

worse so initially I was pretty down onthis card I thought like well uh youknow if you don't like if you if you hitthem with a scale peeler uh they'll justnot gonna they're just gonna not blockwith armor and then later on you'regonna have a one card hand that they canjust flock with armor if you didn'tscale people with them and eventuallythey're gonna get all the value out oftheir armorum but then I tested it against uh oldhim and uh against uh Rampart of theRam's Head uh it is very good becauseyou present scale peeler and then likethey um van brace uh uh our othersideboard arms piece prevents them from

using crown of uh crown of uh seats toprevent the one damage so uh like youcan you know pitch a blue for for ascale peeler and thenum if they try to Crown it then you canuh you can um yeah response to getthrough that damage anyways they can'tblock the dagger with um uh with Rampartbecause uh because it has piercing andthen they can't block the next attackbecause they got the debuff effect rightso the rampart is like useless for theentire term so I thought okay wow thisis great so I started including in mydeck uh well then all the albums figureout that actually Sledge is just way

better against Missouri than uh than uhTitan's Fist and shield so that you knowthere goes that plan so like there'sthere's no point skill peeler anymorelike uh sure you could use it againstlike a Bravo or like Dory or somethinguh but I I don't see it being worth theinclude when you already have likeperfectly viable options like against aBravo you're fine using uh spider biteand uh and Nerf scalpel and I don't seescale people giving you the thepercentage points against that sort ofthing soum yeah that's that's why I'm not uhincluding it so uh okay chess piece uh

you know 300 spring tunic I think ifwe've talked about this before uh thisbroken ass chest uh if this thing wereMajestic or below I would have beenbanned a long time ago but uh because ofthe legendary yeah we're stuck with itum there there is no replacement fortunic um you know every every aspiringcompetitive fat playerum if you look at the top decks you'reprobably going to be dropping some fatones on a FanDuel spring tunic that'sjust the the reality of things as it asit currently stands uh please reprint afew more times thank youum a few more times yeah like the this

this thing allows for some really uhit's a really powerful place like umputting Oasis in your deck Oasis forspite from a sideboard against a nonlike a non-arcane damage because you canjust hold tunic and then like use one toto Oasis uh to cover extra um damage andin that case it becomes like sort of asort of a react that also gains you alife so sort of like a one for five Treact that would be completelyimpossible without tunic right becauseyou'd have to pitch card for it and thenit's the two card blocking for four andgaining One Life potentially so

um yeah tunic enables that it enables umlike a codex a Frailty uh one of themost powerful cards on the main board uhif you it allows plays like uh if youhave a tune encounter you can pitch ablue for a dagger and then you can codexand get back a CNC and then tunic forthe CNC Which is far more powerful thangoing daggeron to leave no Witnesses offof the Codex um because uh spiders biteum CNC is like demands a three cardblock with a no D reacts available rightyeah so just a incredibly powerful play

uh yeah if if you um if you need it tobe on a budget um I think like the newAssassin chest uh redback shroudum is uh is probably worse than heartand crossdrop uh so like red back shroudum it blocks for one and then like uhyou can destroy it to make the cost ofyour attack reaction uh your next attackregression one less so like you knowthis this deck doesn't have any attackraces that cost anything uh so uh likethat does nothing if you're running likePummel or like uh the spikes or a razorreflex uh you could use it for that

um maybe a couple times per game um theproblem is like uh it doesn't Bluff formore than one like you'd think that youcould bring it back to block multipletimes right but the problem is like theopportunity cost of paying two silver tobring this back is that you don't get tobring back your boots you don't get tobring back your mask so like it it endsup being the same amount of block rightif you only have like a mass in yourboots you're gonna be bringing thoseback and if you're like if you'regenerating like six Silver return tobring back all three you don't need uhyou don't need a chest piece to win thatgame right yeah so uh yeah this thisthing looks pretty uh is not very goodthe other the other budget option uh I

think hard and crosstrep is probablyfineum so uh you'd have to maybe play yourdefense reactions a little bitdifferently and maybe not run threeOasis especially if you're met as a lowin Wizard but hardened crosstrap umbecause you can make a single power cardcost two less that makes uh for a decentone card hand once per turn or once pergame where you can blow it up for a CNCor a Shakedown to get something good outof your uh your opponent souh but uh at a competitive level there's

absolutely no replacement no replacementfor tunic yeah black deck Whispers uhboots uh these are really greatum you can uh you know you can give goagain uh one of the most common uses forthem is not really to get go again butactually toum give Shakedown the the on hit effectuh because Shakedown is one of our oneof our power attacks where you need toactivateum uh an attack reaction to to get thelike the on hit effectum so if you don't have a stealth cardto flip into you just need like a pitcha card for it um you can still like uh

just blow up your boots or blow up yourmask of Perdition or flick a knife inorder to get that Shakedown and I'vedone all three so that's one of thereasons also for master predictionum so yeah crown of Providence blockstwo uh Cycles a card uh it's a greatgeneric effect uh in this style of deckwhere I'm runningum uh 12 contract cards uh Masterpartition is just better becauseon average against Decks that are notsay uh Oldham uh you willum you'll almost assuredly

um generate uh like additional twosilver off of just this carduh which means that you'll bring it backonce in which case it already blocks forfor two points which is the same ascrown and then then you have to compareit against the effect of like Crown canuh cycle out a card but this thing uh inexchange for cycling out and not beingable to cycle out a card if you use ittwice and you manage two cards andbashing two cards off the top uh in agame where you're you know like that'suh that's like a 30th of your opponent'seffective life total right becauseyou're you're not just playing their

their actual life points you're playingtheir deck their deck size and Vanishingtwo additional cards very powerfulum and it it also generates like a nicefeedback loop where the more cars youbanish the more you can bring back youruh your black Tech Whispers And yourmask and you can do it again and againuh so I I can't see this any any cardreally replacing thisumalso again because of Shakedown uh andthis card this deck is not as heavy onstealth attacks as some other versionsof Missouri are I only have I think nineof them uh you need to be able to enable

Shakedown and so mask is one of the oneof the Avenues for that I do have adifferent hat in the sideboard uh onearcanized skull cap uh this is not foraggro matchups this is only for dromai Irepeat only for dromai the reason beingagainst romai your only Avenue toVictory with this deck is to fullyfatigue all of their dragons and all oftheir attacks so they cannot do any moredamage to you so they're probably goingto be at like 40 plus life because theygain some life off of sigil and you didlike one damage to them off of dagger inthe entire game so far uh you're gonna

be at like I don't know definitely lessthan four uh so this is always going toget a block for three um your masterprediction is going to do nothing tothem because you're never going to beusing your your contract attacks to goface and you're also never going to usea Shakedown go face because you need itto pop uh so the master partition islike fully useless in that case and theother thing about archive school cap isit has ab3 when they told multi and theyblow up your no room gloves because theyknow that Arcane damage is one of theirwing cons in the very end game you canpitch a blue uh and uh and K3 to prevent

one Arcane damage and that will uhpotentially save you like that cruciallife point so uh organized skill capagain only for Jeremiah if you use itagainst any other deck you are a cowarddon't do italso potentially if they play draconaoptimari that could uh save a lot ofLife there yes yeah maybe like that thenyou would get a true yeah true ab3 yeahthat you know that well that wouldn't betoo bad uh to be able to do that yeah soum quick question though same forbasically the arachni deck was that ifyou have like say two silver and you

could bring back the boots or the maskyou're choosing the masks like nine outof ten times right so actually in thisdeck it dependsumit is a little bit more nuanced with theracket for like for sure because I hadmore more contracts and like uh I'm notlike I'm not running eradicating thisdeck but um Master Perdition uh is goodfor banishing but sometimes that's notwhat you want to doum being able to like give go again toum to uh Shakedownum lets you go like shake down say into

codex frailt uh for like a real powerturnum and uh that like giving and becauseShakedown is like a six power assassinattack that actually benefits from thego again it's much like six power youknow is more likely to hit than than anyof your um one card one card uh handsum and that makes it so that likeplaying like you know going from thatinto a codex from Arsenal um is justlike massively powerful using codex getback leaving no Witnesses and go againuh so I'd say like it is a very contextdependent on what the remainder of your

deck looks like you know you want tolook at your graveyard um how manycodexes you have come in uh how manyshakedowns you played how many leave noWitnesses you played that sort of thinguh so uh it yeah and depending on whatkind of opponent you're playing againstuh How likely do you think you are to beable to you know smash them with a bighand versus how many cars if you need toblock with a four cards a lotum so it depends uh sometimes mask iscorrect because you do want to banishanother card off the top uh butsometimes giving the go again is morepowerful so make senseall right so looking at the rest of thedeck I would say like nothing's too much

different from the Arachne for examplelike a lot of shreds and I like the armput on the plunder the poor the goodcontracts basically yeah so speakingabout good contracts actually so youknow the Majestics okay leaving thewitnesses and surgical instruction arelike it just obvious includes uhcompletely obvious uh CNC and uh for uhfor Zero versus uh and uh like uh youknow Advantage from hand uh incrediblypowerfulum uh and I like the armed and plunderthe poor um they're a good uh they'regood one card hands uh because uhneither played off tunic or for the tour

too hard two card hand um Pitch a bluefor a spider bite and then five powerbecomes a break point because uh theirattacks are only block number two uhplunder poor um decent one card handbecause even though it doesn't have adisruption effect um that also makes itway more likely to hit because theydon't want to spend uh you know twocards blocking something that doesn'thave a a powerful on hit effect but thatmeans you can uh mask uh and uh againstuh against Ranger for example uh you'renearly guaranteed to get uh to get twosilver off point or the poor like uh theonly thing you're going to whiff on

probably is like a candlelight frigid orsomething but yeah Fallout 4 almostalways gets you to to silver with a maskand you can buy that back immediately soum it's a you can almost think of itlike umlike a four plus uh gain a block andsometimes one block is uh more than justyou know one life yeahum one notable exclusion is uh eradicateso I uh I decided to eventually cut allthree eradicates just because it is aone for fourum this thing almost uh almost never

gets you know four um I I was runninglike a cut to the chase the the contractbuff uh buff card um in this before itturns out shred um is just way betterum becauseum you can use it against uh against uhyou can use it for cards that are not uhcontract would not normally beshreddable right like um and well notjust like contract cards but like if youlike play and isolate and they block andthen you can shred and then flip into aCNC and it still applies so likeessentially you got to shred on your CNC

which is like which is amazing right souh so that's that's why um you do wantto uh you you do want to have shredsover cut to the chase uh and cut to thechase uh just being a little bit morenarrow uh means that you're never gonnahave like a an era eradicate for sevenand people are kind of wise to eradicatelike you're probably not gonna get anopponent that is just gonna allow allfour to hitum and if they one card block and uh onthe likely chance that you don't havethe shred um you're gonna banish maybeone card and it's probably not gonna bea yellow uh and um you could have done

something better with your one resourceso uh that's why I kind of eradicatemakes sense uh let's just briefly touchinertia trap out of this one Frailty andblood rot this one is just the mostuniversal and easiest to pull offbasically I think um I think wellthere's an argument between inertia andthe Frailty these Frailty triggers offof go again which is also pretty commonumuh but uh inertia I think uh has a has alot of uses uh for uh you know Ranger ispretty easy to trigger and it's verypowerful against them

um I think Icelander it's one of thereacts you can leave in uh because uhyou can use another wounded bowl andthey're um they're Easter eggs for sevenuh and that that can screw them overum Becca back when I was playing againstuh oldhams that were running Titan'sfist it was really good against Titansfist because you could stop them but itdoesn't work in Slug obviously I thinkit's uh mostly here just to be like aseventh uh defense reaction because athree three sinks and uh three Fates arejust like so so good um initially I wasrunning like a one fate for scene and

two inertia traps um but uh just youknow blocking for four is more thanblocking for three so they're they'reback in yeah um I I can't I can'timagine going below uh three sings threeFatesum and a nursery trap is like a littlebit more uh internship trap is likepretty much what I cut um the thirddecidual saws forum because Central even though it's goodfor like bluffing uh like a attackreactions and and it's good againstwizard there are a way for your Wizardsin this meta and blocking threepreventing an on a hit effect is it

tends to be better than uh than gettingfree life so I'm down to two sigils uhsigil's still good for um Arsenal tolike bait uh CNC it's good for turn zerojust play it to get aheadum but yeah having multiple means thatit's you're more likely to have multiplein a hand and that's not good for whenyou want to walk outall right and now let's let's talk aboutuh pot agreed why do you only run two ofwhat is clearly the best card in thegame this this card is uh absurdlystrongum I this card is like this is like the

channel Mount heroic of Missouri rightum the the one power car that you likeyou need to draw you want to draw all ofthem in a game so that uh you can getyour Spike turnsum the the power of this I I think uhlike relative to the rest of the deck uhcodex for LT isum stronger in uh Stronger Than Azurithan it is in Rangerum because uh you almost always get backleave no Witnesses or a CNC uh andblowing up your opponent's Arsenal uhwhen when you could also like if they

don't have an Arsenal they get back acard they discard a card and then youthreaten blowing up their Arsenal solike they have to maybe block with twocards on their hand then they're leftwith like one card in hand one in theArsenal and they have a Frailty sothey're attacking the Arsenal it doesn'tdo it doesn't do as much damageincredibleumhere's the problem though it blocks twoand uh Carol Mount heroic it blocksthree or four which uh I know Briarsdon't don't like blocking with it muchbut like when you have to block achannel not heroic you're gonna be gladthat it blocks for three or four uh codeexcept Realty when you need to blockwith it you're gonna be cursing the fact

that it blocks twoum and there is nothing worse than whenyou're running three codexflies and youdraw two of them in an early hand andyou don't have gas in your graveyardlike your graveyard is like uh like anAmnesia and a plunder the floor and youdidn't get one of those back and you'relike come on this does nothing and uh soyour options are like you're eitherblock with it or you pitch into daggersfor a second cycle like pitching thedaggers uh completely fine right um Youcan a second cycle is still verypowerful but uh your opponents oftendon't give you the luxury of saving itfor a second cycle um they're gonna bethreatening you very hard and if you

need a block of six power and you haveyou know two codexes in your hand uhyou're probably boned soum having two makes it like just wayless likely to have multiples in asingle hand uh and that that means thatyou can block with three cards inArsenal it and maybe like draw a littleWitnesses or CNC on the next hand andthat makes it way more powerful so um Ithink like uh if you run three like theodds of having to block with one go wayup whereas if you run two it becomes wayless likely that you ever have to blockwith it and in that case you're blocking

two uh and in the matchups where uhremember remembrance is good sometimesyou can just remembers when uh remembersone or two of them back for the lategame where you definitely have uh thewitnesses or CNC or graveyard and thenyou're just still playing here three orfour times soyeah that's that's why I'm only runningtwo uh of course like uh you know if youlike running three uh by all means likeI I would not follow anyone for runningthree of these because it is such apowerful card uh yeah drawing twoessentially uh maybe maybe three peopleup there Arsenal yeah what a card yeahyeah so you don't like this because this

blocks two or you don't run threebecause it blocks two but this carddoesn't block at all so so why do yourun it yeah play Hiveum I I was a harder FanDuel believer fora long time and then I tried playingHive and like man this thing is so goodit is so good uh against Rangerum the the most common deck in The Metauh all three modes are are good becauseuh you know even though you actually aretrying to fatigue them often you arestill life racing them at the same timeyou're fatiguing them and blood Rod isstill good and even as bloodrod is the

weakest mode you have a two-thirdschance of getting inertia of royaltywhich are fantastic against Rangerum against everything elseum like uh long matchups like old him uhyou're gonna be uh rolling this like uhfive times in a game and giving them ininertia like once or twiceum blood rot is is good for healthy isprobably the weakest but it still meansthat you can like a one card blockSledge and take two and that's not badat all so uh every every time you do itlike you're gonna get like at least onepoint of value out of it uh in mostmatchups uh I think I only pretty muchtake it out against a dromai where allthree roads are irrelevant because blood

Rod doesn't matter because they don'tcare about the life um inertia just letsthem Evacuate the D react they had inthe Arsenal so they can put a good cardin their Arsenal instead for Realty doesabsolutely nothing so yeah answer oh mybut again I guess everyone everyone elseuh just having that incidental damage orincidental damage prevention uhincredibleum I I kind of wish that they would stopprinting uh playable fabled cards uhthat are like mechanically unique I likewhat they did with us so good thoughI think I think the problem is like uheven like the The Fairly playable ones

like heart or like what four or fivehundred dollars like um you know imaginewhat happens one day when they printwhen they accidentally print a reallygood one and then it's gonna be likeevery competitive deck Montana it'sgonna be like a thousand dollars becauseit's a fabledum I I wish they would just go back towhat they were doing with a fabled CNCbecause alternate art fables are greatuh it looks fantasticum it drives that value without like umdriving up the value of the originalcard uh but instead you know here we goplay kind of uh it sort of fortunatelyis like somewhere between 100 and 200right now

um yeah that's still a lot of money tospend on a single piece of cardboardthat's like not even eveninterchangeable between multiple decksso I'm not really a fan of the thefabled strategy um but it's you knowit's what we got to do if we want to beable to win so yeah play Hive good cardand so last Stitch effort was also inArachne uh it's part of the end gamestrategy uh we can cover that later butuh let's lastly for main board talkabout spreading plague a little bit yeahso spring plague is uh purely for theultimate matchupum and use a a one of it um as

essentially a finishing blow where youtry to get them to block out your uhelastic effort and then you can givethem two or three blood rods I guesseveryone everyone else uh you're almostnever gonna be casting itum you just block three and because ofblock three like every assassin attackreaction uh that's fine and it's theyellow two so it pitches into your twocosts or daggers yeah it's it's not badtoum uh to have it in your handyep makes sense uh and for the mirror ifa spider's bite this still blocks threeyes but then they're gonna Nerf scalpel

and then it blocks only twobut you would block with this before notin the reaction phase so it's fine yeahwell contextually it it very muchdependsall right so yeah about Oasis just youknow good with tunic uh unmovable tunicis also against uh yeah against umWizards yeah and also against like aAzalea for example because they dominateyou um even if you have to pitch a cardfrom hand sometimes it's worth itbecause you're covering damage right uhunmovableum so I think this card is uh it's greatagainst Bravo

um it's uh quite good against Azalea umbecause you can uh play from hand tocover sevenum and then I also bring it in as a oneof uh againstum against Lexi and Breyer so uh thatmight sound a little unconventional butI am running 19 Blues so it's verylikely you have a blue uh blue to goalong with it and against those twodecks like there are so many instanceswhere uh you're gonna want the two cardblock anyways so like pitching a bluefor an immovable from hand is isbasically you know seven so like aslightly better two card block thannormal

um and it just like slightly buffersyour your deck size count so that you'relike you know 65 cars or whateverum so so that's fine I would not run twoagainst those matchups because if youhave uh two in the same hand it's acomplete disaster yeah so don't do thatbut yeahit's uh it's fine as one of okayremember yeahthis car needs this card needs to bebanned really you think sookay so it's like it's not even becauselike this thing is uh overpowered in theway that like drone of brutality wasoverpowered

um it doesn't like numerically speakingI don't think it like um you know vastlyincreases the the power level of anysingle deck I think the problem is likeit kind of runs contrary to like the Ithink that the the design philosophy ofFab in general where when you play acard it's gone and you pitch a card youcan save it for later but then you canplay for later and it's probably weakerthan the card you played on the firstcycleum remembrance like uh you know dronehad this problem where like it just goesback and goes back and goes backremember says a similar problem where uheven though it's limited in the amount

of times you can use it it's it's ageneric that anyone can run uh it's aninstant that costs zeroum and you get to bring back three threepowerful cards toum kind of like a uh change the orimprove the power distribution of yourof your deck later in the game uh andagainst uh longer matchups that's that'spretty goodum even if it costs you like a one cardworth of tempo uh in in the mid gameyeahum the fact that you canin fact I'm running three of thembecause of Drumline and just purelybecause of dromai you bring back nine

poppers that gives you instead of 12poppers at 21. like you almost doubleyour popper count uh just to just off oflike these three cars on the sideboarduh which to me seems ridiculous and likewhat is drama what does drama do tocounter that um they run like uvia andrate for Embers and then like theyremembers those back so that they cangenerate more and more ashlings so thatyeah you're a poppers are not aseffective right like back when I wasplaying Arachne um uh like theremembrance can bring back uh uhlegendary keyboard cards that aresupposed to be one once per deck so thatyou're supposed to only use the most pergame but no you just bring them back

with remembrance so like Imperial warhorn blubber Frost text uh remembers itback and do it two more times and thenwhat does Icelander do to counter thatuh well they remember that they bringtheir own remembrance to to bring backFrost taxes and I say Turtles and it'slike it's just like a it's like a stupidlittle arms race where like if if uhyour opponent is running zeroremembrance and I'm running oneremembrance then like I'm gonna havelike a slight Edge right because I getan additional effects only plus two carsagainst them uh and then they're okaythey're like well I they're going to runtwo remembrances to so they're going tohave one over me well maybe I run three

references and then but what if I runthree remembrances and what my opponentruns is zero remembers is like a lean 60so they can try to kill me and I havelike a dead hand that has like tworemembrances in it and I can't block aswellum and yeah it like it it ads is likesomewhat of a variance uh meta game umthat just I don't I don't think it needsto be uh in Fab like it doesn't reallyadd anything to the game of Flesh andBloodum there's there's no reason for thisthis card to be in the gameum so yeah I I think it should go uh butsince it's since it's not banned well uhwe're gonna be bringing back uh nine

poppers makes sense all right and thenuh no roon basically for wizards for themost part yeah yeah yeah for wizards uhav3 against uh Wizards and then uh foragainst uh room blade I would also bringin uh ab2 so uh Lantern and gloves yepmakes sense and then once Rosetta's gonemaybe you can go down to one again yeahall right so I thought it was basicallythe deck I think we covered most thingsum we alsocovered a lot of notable exclusionsalready so um let's uh a couple of

others let's see yeah there's a littleexclusions I think there's like a okay acouple things I tested um like aconcealed blade uh like that blue d-rexso like when I was uh playing Iraqi Idid run like the blue cut to the chasein the blue slot to give a plus one touh to my contract cards so you thinkthat this would just be a better versionof that right like you flick a knife andthen uh and then you can use this as ablue uh and and then load up anotherknife so you still have two uh inpractice it doesn't work that way it

just likeum you want to be pitching your bluesand you don't want to be plus plusrunning especially when you're uh comewhen a lot of your power attacks arelike six and uh they're like to cover itif against isolate maybe they have likethree from hand plus a d react fromArsenal for sevenum giving plus one it just comes up soinfrequently that you need um you needto have uhuh you need to have enough concentrationof attacks and speaking of the tax I Idon't think we went over this so likethe in the Blues

um oh yeah yeah I I do have a mix like Ididn't I didn't just bring in like allthe all the possible stealth cards rightso like my Blues are like three shredsuh so shred uh is pretty good Ifunnily enough I think um blue shred isthe weakest of these but I just need tohave enough concentration of Blues topassively defend against Wizard and alsobecause I want to be pitching intodaggers a lot so still three bluethreads and then uh two red shreds anduh two yellow shreds uh red shred inthis deck is better than red shred andArachne because uh very often uh if youisolate uh and uh and then you flip and

they can like uh they're gonna syncbelow before you uh resolve Missouri butuh then your red thread is uh full minusfour so you get that full minus fourmore frequently than you would with Iraqknee so I think Red Thread is prettygood in this deck I still don't want toomany of them becauseum having like a handful of shreds is isnot where you need to be and a lot ofdecks uh just like don't block and thenyour threads are useless so uh yeah yougot to be careful with uh with this cardespecially if you Arsenal itum you usually only one Arsenal shredagainst a Decks that are like almostguaranteed to block you otherwise you're

gonna be like uh drawn hands where youreally want to Arsenal and D react butthen your Your Arsenal is full and youhave no way to evacuate soum yeah definitely be careful when whensticking your shred an Arsenal yeah Iisolate so I think isolate for Missourias like a flip uh a flip Catalyst uh isis just the best one because dominatesuh dominates gross so I'm running the umthe blues and the yellows I'm notrunning the Reds just becauseumyellows can at least pitch uh into uhinto that into daggers and uh and reds

cannot and uh zero for three dominate uhif you don't flip and flip intosomething is like just pretty bad uhbackstab I think is uh for for this deckuh it's the second beststealth card uh because you can uh flipinto CNC so like sometimes they're goingto be forced to just uh block straightup uh six against this uh if they don'twant to like lose two cards from Arsenalif they're uh if they're on New Horizonsuh in which case you can use Arsenal CNCand you're in good shape so yeahbackstab is good

um and then the the rest of the Blues sobesides surgical uh and the lastShepherds I also have a three-pointerreport and uh two and I like the armedum this is uh for a few things one beingum just having more contract densitywhere uh in the late game uh likeplayingum a single a plunder the poor blue uhis still good because it forces a cardeither way either from from their handor the top of the deck and then with theNightLight the arms you can pitch a blueuh to a spider bite and then and thenthe three power becomes a breakpointbecause their attacks are blocking for

twoum it's also for draw my as welldromai the The Little Dragonsum like two power or sorry two two lifeis okay okay you can dagger chromitetwice but um as of why and uh uh andyanderei and ethimai uh and amerigai arelike big problemsum and you need to be able to kill themif you don't have uh like a four powerattacking Arsenal or something uh inwhich case like uh these Blues becomeyour you know your line of defense andyou really don't want to have a handwhereas like all stealth cards and you

need like dagger dagger uh like backstabinto into a yandere or something and youstill don't kill it so uh you just uhyeah you need to have some some amountof density of like a two plus power bluecards so that's uh that's why this deckis built the way it ismakes sense very very uniqueconstruction lots of two of some oneof'svery very interesting I would say yeahand like you know no no um no spikes uhno razor reflex no no Pummel like I Itried the one funnel at first but it was

a it was way too inconsistent and italso only blocks too so uh where thisdeck is like maximum consistency youjust want to like hit your uh hit yourdisruptionsum hit your silver generation with thecontract cards uh block block uh codexfor your Spike turns and that's about itand eventually you're just gonna win bywin by attrition so there you goall right I think that do you have anyother notable exclusions before we moveon to match-upsI think that's about it all right soundsgood all right I have prepped a littleZuri matchup list

soum let's just goalphabetical Arachneyeah so uh I have cued into some Iraqison talashar um I think I put this infavor like not heavily favored but yeahum Arachne even though he has the uh thedeck manipulation ability I again it'spretty weak you're drawing four cards aturn uh you get to you get to flip likea backstab dominate into into cards thenhehe can't do it uh he just cannot do that

so you can uh you know blow out withdamage and also uh Rockne when they'refacing youum they know that like you know thatthey're on fatigue but that you might uhfor all their for all they know youcould be on red line and uh if they'reon like a a very heavy like a fatigueplan um they they might be trying to uhbe prepared for like a Beatdown butinstead you're also going to counterfatigue them right so against Arachneyeah just bring in like a full 68 uhcards like all three remembrances justgo for the long game and uh you'reprobably gonna be okay

um it's it's definitely not like a freewin but um just you have a you have abetter ability so that makes you thebetter slightly better hero text yeahand then uh let's go and thespecializationalso true yeah Azalea so Azalea is uh isfavoredum not like not like heavily favored umbecause uh with all the new cards theygotum they get big dominates uh and I Ithink this one's like nearly a 50 50 butyou have a slight Edge because uh likeuh theThe Oasis the unmovables uh you have a

you have a good ways toum you have good ways to like kind ofget around big dominates also um thething about dominate is that if you'renot blocking with all your cards fromhand that means you get more cards to dostuff to them and your your cards thatdo stuff are pretty good right like aShakedown CNC leave no Witnesses allthese are very good against uh Azaleathey want to be pretty light on d-reactsbecause they don't want to uh you knowAzalea into a d reactum and uh and that means that you get touh you get to disrupt them and if you um

if you're leaving the witnesses you'reusually getting two cars out of theirhand and so that that nurse their Spiketurns but um the the main way of I'velost azaleas and testing is that theyrun a clean 60 and then they just likeuh go for maximum consistency and try tolike big dominates for like 14 15 asmuch as possible and uh I can't you knowI can't fully block it outum and uh I'm not able to completelyfatigue them in time I think if Azalearuns like a 70 plus cards um theconsistency just goes down a lot and uhyou're fine with yourself fatigue amount

um I guess Azalea I would probably notbring in any remembrance because there'sno way they can counter fatigue you soit would just be like two or twoimmovables and three Oasis from thesideboardthat makes sense all right moving on toBolton yeah I have no idea uh idea Ihaven't I have not played against asingle bulletin on this deckArrow belowput them in the question mark tier yeahI feel I feel like it like it should befavored uh because um because like uh

they're like if they're on a combo planum they they might be trying to likeblock you out until they can assemblethe assemble like the double tripleLumina yeah but you have a ways to likeuh banish cars from the hand andbanished cards uh or destroy cars fromthe Arsenal uh oh speaking of banishingcars in my hand like um random thought Ihad about Shakedown is that I think uhwhen LSS were designing Shakedown umthey were trying to get more ways oflike uh you know banishing opponent'scards um but they were running out ofdesign space so like if you look at thetext it's basically just like a strictly

worse version of um of surgicalextraction right because like uh likesurgical is just like guaranteed onceyou hit uh you know you bash your carfrom the top you banish the car from thehand uh and then you make silver whereasshake down you don't get to make silveryou don't get the batch from the top uhand it has a condition on on what youcan do and you have to choose a colorbefore knowing what their hand is uh solike uh there's a little more skillinvolved um but Shakedown being read youknow that makes it two points betterthan surgical so I I do think it's alittle funny that uh they might havelike kind of designed themselves into a

corner with a how many differentbanished effects they can get uh get outof assassin soumuh but yeah with that uh and andSurgical and and CNC that can all beflipped intoum I think uh you might be favored butagain I have no idea it could just belike maybe Bolton just counters Missourisomehow uh I've never tested it againstone because I've just never encountereda single one in the wildmakes sense all right moving on to Bravoyeah Bravo so Bravo used to be uhunfavored uh for Israel or for iraqni umnow this is a favorite matchup

um yes this is favored sothe way that Bravo the way that Bravowins is through big dominates whereyou're not uh where you're just like cutout with your pants downum and that has that they have to likechain that turn after turn after turnwhile you don't have and like and youdon't draw into your Oasis and you'reunmovableum whereas uh Missouri is like extremelyhard to to block for Guardian unless youhave uh old hymns uh abilities right andthe crown of seatsum Bravo doesn't have that uh Native uh

damage prevention so like the only wayhe blocks is a through armor whichdoesn't work against daggers uh Bthrough just like block hand and Cthrough uh D reacts and uh d-reactsagainst Missouri uh like are tend to belike pretty bad when you have a backstabthat can flip into CNC uh when you haveisolate that doesn't allow more than oneID react and then like you see CNC theydon't do react or if they have one inthe Arsenal they might have to overd-react uh into it and then and then youflip into something that's like not too

powerful and they like they wasted theirthings um and uh Bravo's like uh inaddition to like the the sink and fateSuite um they really only have access tolike um staunch and unmovable and thoseare those are like not great uh whenthey're played at Blue uh becausethey're they're covering essentiallyfive right so uh five or or maybe six soum it just makes it so that like it'sreally easy to chip into Bravo and uh Iguess against the nothos like uh walking

for for six and then like flipping backin for for sixum uh makes it makes things hard forthem because like they they don'tnecessarily want to block six CardsAgainst the backstabum and and lastly like uh codex frt umlike is a I'd say like code of Frailtyis more of a power Spike card thancrippling crush is uh even whendominated because like with cripplingum you you don't know if your opponentis going to be able to walk you out andoften they are because they're preparedwith a d-reacting Arsenal uh whereaslike with a with codex like you're

always going to get something uh andit's probably going to be two cars fromhand somehow soum this like just like the the cart theexpanded card pool and the hero abilityhave uh turned this uh matchup into notquite as good for Bravo as it used to bemakes sense all right let's move on toBriar that's on Briar yeah I think uhBriar is pretty close to 50 50. abouthis 50 50 as a as you can getum and this is because like Briar is ispretty soft to disruption right becausebeing a room blade uh you do need to

chain together some things to to makeyour turn go the way you want like ifyou just like ravenous Rebel uh intoScarborough scar into exude like it'sstill like a good turn but it's not likethe the power Spike turn you really needto to get your get all of your damagethroughum and that makes Briar a little bitsoft to fatigue like um they can't dothe the rice River punishment Tech likethey can with ultim because you're justgonna surgical them in the uh you knowin late gameum and uh against Briar like I'm runningum uh oh so for Bravo like the sideboard

would be like a three Oasis uh two onmobile it's probably two remembrance Iwouldn't run the all three remembrancebecause you don't want to be caught outwith two of them but two is probablyfine against Briar one remembrance isfine because you can pitch it for a b uhand uh I would run one immovable and uhfree Oasisum Oasis being good against Arcanedamage it's good against Rosetta tocover all fourum and uh against Briar he wants to likeflip uh flip every other turn or everyturn if you can do it uh and then blockout still uh where applicable

um and of course avoid the the channelMatt heroic Spike turns but um it's it'shard for Briar to land those um thosebig spike turns because like what youreally want is like a big five-parkedhand with like force of nature uhchannel Matt heroic into into bigattacks and it's very hard to line thatup when Missouri can disrupt you prettyconsistently if you're trying to set uplike that soum makes sense yeah I think it's a 5050. but of course she's still veryaggressive so I I can't I can't say it'sbetter than 50 50. yeahall right dash I mean Dash is weird

because you know you can talk aboutdifferent kinds of Dash but yeah exactlyso um aggro like if they're if they'retrying to boost you you just block in ina free winum yeah you just winum the tree frog Dash uh pretty much onauto loss like I'm not running war hornto blow up itemsum there's they're gonna be pretty likepretty heavily teched into uh into Dreacts and like a lot of blues uh andthey're gonna have be presenting like afat 60 and then like um it's just sohard to deal 40 damage before she gets

uh you know five plus five plus fiveum uh consistently right and you andyou're still running like d-rex yourselfso like you can't like to convert yourentire hand into damage like a red X canso uh the yeah fully defensive uh pistolDash um probably I'll probably go nextum the the item Dash I'd still say it'slike 50 50. so like this is kind of likethe same um uh the same evaluation Igave Arachne whereum where I thought also like the epistleDash was a 50 50. um this is one case

where I think arachne's hero ability isactually very impactful uh in thismatchup and that makes it so that eventhough we have a nice expanded carpoollike codex Realty is really good againstum the hybrid Dash where they're tryingto Pistol plan youum because most hybrid dashes are goingto be bringing the pistol package andtrying to assemble all the pistols umand like maybe they're gonna be boostingfor like the high octane turns butthat's about it yeah um Arachne becausehe can put Reds to the bottom uh to maketheir second cycle really bad uh they'relike it makes the pistol plan way worsefor them Azure doesn't have the ability

to do that so they're going to be veryefficiently blocking with red cards onfirst cycle and pitching all their bluecards so that once they get the secondcycle which they they definitely will umon second cycle they're going to be likeall Blues all gas into their pistolsum and uh even though we have like uhthe ability to still flip into goodcards um you still need to kill thembefore they can assemble all that so itis it is difficultum and uh that's why I can't make ithigher than a 50 50. I don't think it'sunfavored though so yeah it's a it'susually whenever I sit across a hybridDash it ends up being a pretty

interesting game makes sense yeah andthey can like lean a lot of ways toowith Hyper Dash so it's like hard to sayfor sure yeah exactly moving on to Doryuh Tori I have no idea um also againthis is in the question marks I need toplay against shinmore uh because Shinour resident uh Dory Master Shin uh hehas a kid and uh he can't play as muchas he used toum and also like we keep missing eachother at like the the one place we canplay uh soum I I need to like a test against himmoreum against like the random stories on uh

on talashar like it's a you knowbasically a free win because uh nobodyknows how to play properlyum so uh I think compared to acneum we there's like so much more thatassassin has now uh one being thedaggers right instead of being twospider bites which are just absolutelydead cars now you get to run orbitalclass and or scalpel which like uh uhdefinitely have a big impact against thehand and how efficiently Doria can blockum you get to have codex which isincredible against Don blade right minusone against both Dom blade swings it'sjust so good

um and then uh and then you can ofcourse flip into good cards to disrupttheir hand in their Arsenal so I thinkit's much better I don't know if I wouldcall it favorite but like I don't thinkit's worse than 50 50 now so yeah put itput in the question mark for nowdefinitely needs more testing there werea few stories at the PT I didn't get tosee much of thatI'm moving on to draw myokay so draw myum drama is a spectrum right so on onone end you have likeum like the Jamie Faulkner Ian Zhang uhdeck list where it's just like 70

dragons uh three remembranceumif you sit down across that uh go getlunch um like don't even waste your timeuh so uh because they're gonna they'regonna be remembersing back uvias and andrakes and like uh maybe the minionsDominion if they're feeling spicyum and uh eventually they're just likeuh they're they're ghostly touch isgonna smack you for for 15 right becauseuh you only get 21 poppers and that'sall you get once you're out um then thenyou're gonna get ghostly touched it uhor you're gonna get like a Arcane pinged

to deathum and like the if your Ash wings arejust like a very efficient um and theonly way to kill uvia uh is either likeyou swing a popper into itum which is not efficient or you like adagger uh dagger dagger plus four whichrequires like a three card hand almostuh if you don't have tunic up so uh veryvery difficult toum to uh to kill that uh to kill thatplan uh dragons are just so good uh onthe other end of the the draw mySpectrum you have the extremely aggrolike uh I think the most popular variantis the empress Stromae that um that Mars

been running and took to a second placefinish at the PT uh that one I thinkum I think it's a round of 50 50. so uhstill not favored because of the theaccess to dragons and because like uhthey're arrested cards a lot of themwere still pretty good like Rogermetamorph uh if you know if you pop itthey get another burn them all that'sthat's pretty goodum but uh because uh you're stilldefensively teched into being able toblockum and uh and uh daggers are still likethey're not they're not like kadashilevel of clearing small dragons butthey're still decent at clearing like

you can double dagger into kyloria andit's not too bad uh or or chromaium but uh because they're lighter ondragons they're probably not going tohave as many remembrances and you have ahigh popper density you get to you getto pop a lot soum that one I would put around 50 50.and then uh of course there's a lot ofvariants where like uh the they'resomewhere in between where they'rerunning uh anywhere between a lot ofattacks to a little attacks to noattacks almost so uh overall uh I thinkyou can put it in unfavored but the thetwo most popular variants are like the

big dragon that's like go next and thenlike the the the empress that I feellike is around 50 50. I haven't testedinto toum the best Empress players so I don'tknow if that's actually true but I feellike I feel like that's what it shouldbe so uh yeah you can put it on favor inunfavored but I think that's uh maybe alittle bit misleading so it is a littlesad that even with all the like even allwith all the the amount of deck warpingthat we have to do to to make all thesepoppers fit um it's still like not not agood match up so uh still the bestadvice against Real why is just dodge

yeahalways is yeah very polarizing yeah in aton of cards and it's still just notgreatyeah all right let's move on to Phiuh so if Ium has dropped a bit of a weird spotright now yeah he's very much droppedout of the meta um and there wereactually more katsus in the files uh solike the you know the consistent uh metais like uh the consistent fives are notthere I think um this matchup uh in inmy personal testing is somewhere arounda 50 50 now like it used to be like itgo next um but uh maybe on like the low

side of 50 50 like almost unfavored Ithink what makes this matchup a lotbetter is that like you don't have to beon a fatigue plan you can actually raceum because uh fight really doesn't likewalking uh your disruption effects areprobably gonna hit and your disruptioneffects are good like a three card handfor fight is a lot worse than a a fourcard hand right so taking one card awayuh very powerful also um uh a lot ofgames I played it feels like the thematch uh tends to go likeum kind of like a slightly slightlyunfavorable for me like I'm a little bit

behind in the tempo race until I hitcodex Realty and then codex like just aone card hand completely turns that uhTempo aroundum like uh you know destroys the carfrom Marshall maybe get some of thediscarded cardum uh makes uh makes her Amber bladeswing for one less uh and then uh if youdo it and you get to ponder you know ifyou do it twice then uh you tend to bein pretty good shape so uh uh somepeople say like the ranger mirrors comedown to whoever draws their codex firstbut uh in this case like five matchescan come down to like how how soon doyou drive your codex and how impactfulis it right so yeah that card is

definitely a huge power card in the inthe fine mesh up um but I think overallit's a it's about a 50 50 nowmakes sense all right moving on toIcelander also yeah right now this thisone's incredibly hard to evaluate I Iwould actually put in question markedhereum so uh I I played against uh oneIcelander uh inum uh in uh uh in in Baltimore yeahwhich I won so like um the way I wantthat one and the way I think that thematchup should be approached is thatum because we're not on the like the war

horn on tank planum yeah bring in like bring in a clean60 uh and like just take out some deepreacts and put in three Oasis uh andthen you just umuh you you kind of just uh swing as hardas possible for for Tempo and try torace them on Tempo um and then if youyou need to see what the Icelander isdoing like if they try to like set upprocesses to try to late game you umthen you need to like go hard and likesmash their face as much as possible totry to kill them um but also like uh Ithink it's more likely what they're

gonna try to do is also try to Tempo youlike you know try to keep um a littlebit even in life life totals uh usuallyit's said that like if icelanders youknow Five Points under your life for theentire game then you're gonna losebecause then they're gonna startstraight As you um but uh you don't haveto do that for the entire game you canonly you can do that until you're likehalfway through the game and then if ifyou've gotten them to like block withprocesses and Ice eternals uh you canjust like pivot to to a fatigue plan umand that's that's what I did like that'show I won myum uh my PT match against icelanderslike uh there were like two or three ice

or two or three Arctic incarcerationsgone like two frostacks and two icetturtles goneum and then as soon as I I saw that washappening we were like both in the 20sof life or something and I just likeimmediately switch to Heart fatigue andI I beat as much as possible for therest of the game and he did not have carenough cars and deck to kill me soum just with 19 blues uh there's apretty good amount of umpretty good uh pretty good amount ofways to mitigate thatum I think in this matchup uh

most uh most icelanders are still onlike the Michael Hampton uh window listyeah yeah I was uh I was on like 3Dreacts I think I ran like one inertiatrap in two uh Saint below so that meansyou take out three favorite scenes inone scene belowum so you bring in threeum Oasis and one remembrance to make upthe difference right and then with theremembranceum there are a few things you can dowith it like generally you don't want touse it in the mid game because you coulda b with it instead but like you can getan Arsenalum you can uh you can get back some

blues with it to increase the blueconcentration of your deck which I thinkis a not a bad thing to do another thingyou can do with it is if they do try tolike iceternal you uh you can like getsome pros hexes and then you can orsorry like if you can get somefrostbites and if you have Frost taxeson you you can pitch cards to play aremembrance or a Sigil from Arsenal umto like blow up the frostbites and thenyou don't take as much Arcane damage inthe end phaseum so uh yeah some tricks you can dowith that uh so yeah my gut says likemaybe 50 50 but like I I really don't

know I've only played against uh likeyou know one Icelander in the PT uh souh yeah I probably probably need moretesting as good ashlanders um talasharis no place to practice againstIcelander because everyone on there isjust terrible at playing Icelander soum yeah don't don't even bother shotsfired okayum moving on to uh Kano 's also aquestion mark I haven't played againstlike uh any extremely experienced uhkanos uh like uh at a competitive levelum with with Missouri and uh

testing like it usually comes down to uhwe try to go to a sort of a fatigueStyle game where I throw it through sixdamage they block my two cardsum and I I think they block my Orbiterclassum and then they try to set up like TheEther wildfire and I try to have anoasis in my Arsenalum I I don't know like uh if it if it'ssupposed to go differently from that Ithink if the Kano like hits their goodcars early they can like try to comewith you way sooner and you just gottahope you have the devices readyum and meanwhile like uh I like isolateflip into a disruption card is really

good because it forces them to like uhyou know spend all their cards on Kanouh immediately soum it can be powerful yeah I just I justuh don't know how it's uh actuallysupposed to go at a competitive levelthere were a few kanos at theum at the PT but I don't think any ofthem made the top tables somoving on to KatsuI'd say it's really interestingum I think in this matchup like uh himand Phi uh the cyborg Strat is basicallyto to change nothing from the sideboardright like I don't bring in Oasis

um or or remembrance or unmovablebecause they don't have big attacksOasis like uh yeah there's too muchchance of breaking uh if you don't havethe um the tunic counter available uhbecause you need to have available tomake efficient use of itum against spy also sometimes like theirtheir shuko can I can screw you becauseuh Oasis can't uh it makes our taxi likeit can't be prevented so if you're notcareful about that that um then yourOasis doesn't workum and then like click Hive even thoughit's a non-block uh it's still uh prettygood like uh you're probably gonna beracing some blood or it's good inertiais not bad and then Frailty is goodagainst both of them so it's especially

good against Realty it's like it justnuts uh both the token from plague andalso from codex and Frailty uh turningoff katashi's is amazing um Amnesia uhthere's two Amnesia in the deck and eventhough uh even though it's umuh it's like not actually there forkatsu it doesn't like incidentally hitkatsu which is which isn't bad uh Iplayed against one one katsu at the PT II won like with 20-0 or something it wasit was not close because um that one Idid kind of high roll I just like hitdisruption after disruption afterdisruptionum but katsu can still have you know

very big uh Spike turns and with adescendant bonds line uh if you getgetting Dishonored as Missouri is it isnot terrible you can still like pitchyour pitch yourself card for it uh it'slike definitely not the end of the worldbut it's still like a it's still adefinitely a Nerf uh to Azuri um andum and bonds line is just very powerfulin general because they can like get ridof 100 wins I think you're rid of fosterfist just for white damage uh and uh aslong as you can like um stifle the thespike turns the katsu you're usually inpretty good shape because the costume

doesn't block very well either uh so Ithink unlike fire which is veryconsistent uh even with a free card handI think casu goes into the favoriteterritoryum because uh because they need a littlebit more like a few more um movingpieces still work together to get towork yeah makes sense all right movingon to levia probably I have no idea Ithink uh I think uh Alan was the onlyyeah had results yeah yeahum but he also went O3 in draft on dayone uh soum there it goes right so we'll we'll

never know maybe he uh maybe he wouldhave done great on day twoum but I have no idea how this matchupis uh I feel like it should be goodbecause like um you sort of like putmore cards in their blood debt and likeif they have one bad turn they just diebut uh but they could maybe they justkill you I don't knowoh yeah the most popular deck at the protour and I think just in general rightnow uh Lexium has kind of been like a fan favoritehero for a long time um has gotten a lot

of like incidental uh banlist uh hatelike uh first it was like what balllightning uh and then uh and then likeuh yeah yeahso many so many hits that like weren'ttargeted at her but like they justnerfed her and now finallyum she gets her chance to shine and it'slike almost purely because of Voltaireand not because of because of her rightyeah like um having access to stuff likeuh uh stuff like um Channel like uhfrigid andum and like lightning surge for for acodex line

um uh is like they're all good but uh ifyou I think if you like completely gotrid of all the ice and lightning carsfrom her cardpool should still be reallystrong just because Voltaire gets you uhgets you two arrows a turn right uh andthen if you have an arrow Arsenal that'sthree arrows uh and Rain Racers is sixdamage on a three Arrow turn which isreally good yep um so the key to uh toLexi I think for this matchup is to stopher Spike turns as much as possible ifyou can get her to just like Arrow arrowand then pass Arrow Arrow pass Arrow

pass you're in great shapeum because like that's very easy toblock out and like you can likesometimes like just one card block someof the Arrows with a less relevant onhits and you can return uh moredisruption uh so you want to chain yourdisruption as efficiently as possibleLexi sucks at blocking like absolutelyterrible at blockingum so uh there's a there's a very littlewaferum her to stop your uh on hits withoutuh losing a lot of cars from handanyways which also notice your return uhso uh I played against one Lexi onstream in round four uh which was like a

pretty uh pretty one-sided uh game whereI just uh don't I just had a lot ofdisruption um and then I played I guessanother oneum on day two and that was much closerand actually uh if he hadn't if hehadn't punted uh on his codex line umwhere he like he returned a lightningsearch face down he flipped it based upand he had an endless arrow in Arsenaland instead of playing the endless Arrowto give it go again he just played thelightning surge like whoopsum but uh like that could have beenwinnable for for the second Lexi right

so like it's it's definitely not evenclose to an auto win I'd still put it infavor um my gut says like 60 to 65 infavor of uh sorryum because you get to uh disrupt uh anduh and I think like that's one of thehighest uh win percentages uh againstLexi that like any hero in this formathas so um if if your meta is trackableAlexa maybe consider playing Azuribecause uh the disruption is like damngood and also if they bring an iceagainst you like um having Blues insteadof being on the red line makes you a lot

better yeahI think it's interesting because um Ifeel like Bravo and Missouri are prettysimilarbut the main difference I find is thatAzuri well other than the weapon ofcourse is that Azuri prevents moreefficient disruption whereas Bravo youreally need to keep a lot of cards yesso Bravo like you you almost always needto like pitch two cards for a third cardright so if your third card's in YourArsenal you only get to block with twocards and then and and your arm aroundonce your Armor's gone it's gone umwhereas with Zuri uh you can Arsenal anda stealth card block with three cards

and then the next turn you block withthree cards and then you like flip intoyour fourth card which is like a CNC andthen you you still have incrediblyconsistent disruption and of coursecodex Frailty is uh just amazing so uhyeah that makes this match up I think uhjust uh not not too not too shabby atall um the Cyber plan for Lexium is pretty similar toum Azalea just like uh won a movableinstead of two and then a three uh threeOasis um and you really do want to hopethat your Oasis lines up with um withyour tunic but you also just do need itto prevent break points because uh there

are a lot of fives coming in so you canlike uh you know piece of Armor Plus uhplus the Oasis and a lot of force comingin like a yeah if their last Arrow justcomes out of Arsenal like a drill shotor something then proven E4 is reallygood sense soum a little bit more Nuance on the let'ssay mashup also like some of them willtry to counter fatigue You by bringing aton of cardsum in that case just kill them like uhyeahif they're if they're in like the high70s uh their consistency is just notgoing to be there they're gonna have a

lot more ranger hands and your damage islike still you're gonna be veryconsistent so you can kill them justwith damage um if they're running a lean60 you should be blocking as much aspossible and you can fatigue them prettyeasily so yeahmakes sense all right let's say let'ssave all them for last sure yeah the bigbad let's move on to Reiner alsoprobably imagine I I have played againsta few pretty decent rhinars um I I wantto say like this is favorite but likevery slightly favored um like maybe evenlike the top of the 50 50s uh like you

know somewhere in between favor and 5050.um Reiner uh I think against Reinhardtyou want to bring in like two to threeOasis uh three Oasis can't get clunkywith um intimidates uh so but at leasttwo um two unmovable so that you can putan Arsenal for a big attack and also uhone remembrance uh it's because like arhinoum they're probably expecting you tosomewhat try to fatigue them and theymay very well be running a remembranceto bring back like a blood rush Bellowsand two attacks or like two or shabellasand attack uh and Reiner even though helike sort of self fatigues through the

um through uh through like discardingum sometimes how the game plays out isthat like because he can intimidate anddo big attacks against you if he chunksyour life down uh enough then he's goingto be doing like um you know roll scapskins swing with a robin club or uh ormandible claws uh just uh to try toweapon you down and his weapons arebetter than yours right he has almostlike a guardian level weapon where uhtwo for two for four or five is prettyefficient and also like a two for threego again is also very efficient so uhthose are those are very good

um and for you like the plan is stillyou know disruption uh try to try toknock out their their non-attacks morethan their uh attacksum but uh I I don't know if I would runto orbit a class in this matchup itmight be better than um the spider biteum I I think uh you do want to do maybea little bit of scouting on like how uhlike what kind of a deck your opponentis running if they're like the veryaggressive 60 card uh deck or if they'rerunning like a lot of sync below a favorscene in which case that Nerf scuffle uhmight be might be really good

um but there's yeah there's some NuanceTodd's played um but we're on ours is Ithink a very uh even though he's a smallpart of the meta uh he's a verydangerous opponentlet's move on to Riptide remember that'sa free win like this is the this is theonly like I think true free win in theentire uhuh in the entire metagame right now soum a lot of people can say that about aRiptide though right I have a I havelost once to Riptideum uh against my uh my friend John ho uha pretty good player he was testing uh

he was testing like an anti-fatigue listwith like a he was running remembrancelike a quiver of Bissell depths uh hewas runningum like a three give and take uh and Idid get counterfeit so ever since then Isaid okay I'm not gonna lose that wayagain so uh the plan against Riptide youbring him the entire 68 all threeremembrance and then uh you uh you justnever dagger himum until you see collapsing trap beingplayed So likeum uh and you never activate uh anattack reaction until you seeum what was it was the other one likethe buzz saw or is that one Spike pit

yeah I think it's the one that yeah thatMills you yeah you never activate anyreaction until you see you spike bit andthen you never you never dagger untilyou see collapsing trap and then likeonce if he pitches those like you trackthe pitch uh and then like once it'scoming up uh you just like you just likeplay a single car from him um you likeyou never flip you just like pitch yourum you pitch your stealth card for anattack uh and then like he he cannot outmacro you because you're gonna be cuthim for two or six he's gonna in orderto not die he's gonna have to block twocards you're going to win that macrocard advantage and then like uh your

your allowance you have like you want toblock out like basically everything hecan present because he's probably goingto be running a pretty low to the groundlike um a lot of zero costs so he'sgonna like nimbleism into like a a cheapArrow which is like if you two cardblock that's two cars for two cards soyou can trade even on cars until youattack him and he's forced to block inwhich case um then uh then you'rewinning on on a card tradeum and uh if uh if he uh like yourallowance for taking damage is that likesometimes he's gonna if you if you knowlike it's not collecting trap and likeyou dagger into like a target Trap orsomething using a penny for damage and

you expect to get pinged maybe likethree to five times in a game uh andthen the other uh the rest of that islike if he plays give and take with likea nimbalism or somethingum and he does it like three times youcan expect to take like uh like 18damage off of three game and takes thatare pumped right so that's um that'slike yeah 25 damage at maximum that he'sgonna be able to leak through and thenyou block out everything else and thenyou play a single card from hand everyturn to disrupt uh and that's it um andthen you cannot lose a to Riptide that'suh that's how it goes

makes sense this guy this guy needs thisthis guy needs some help like I don'tknow what I mean clearly he has one lesslife so there's something about himthere's something uh in in the adultversion he's two less life right sorrytwo less think about it think about thisway like starvo 40 life hero 538 lifehere obviously servo's hero power is notas good as her ties right clearlyclearly yeah so uh with Riptideum think like uh if they wanted to ifelse just wanted to like make him alittle bit more competitive in thefutureum they can't really lean into like the

the Trap ping part of umof his like the second part of his textuh because that that is only going toget a couple points per game and it kindof like I guess it kind of makes up forthe 38 to 40. so like some there has tobe something good about like the the youknow the first part of his text wherelike he has to have a lot of cards thatcan only be played from Arsenal so deathtouchum and like what virulent touch fromthis Set uh that can only play fromArsenal like those are perfect Riptidecards but um maybe he needs more stufflike that and more decentspecializations that are not just uh thetraps for him to be uh more viable than

he currently isall right let's move on to visceralumthat's right I think well he's not afree win but I think he's definitelyfavored uh we're I'm discounting thelike the the memeotk region blade deck um which I haven'tI haven't tested against and like Idon't even know if it's like a um anauto loss like it was for Arachne likemaybe you can just push enough damagewith a like isolation backstabs andstuffum the the general like a you knowaggressive uh variant of um uh of Israel

like this would be one of the mostfavored uh but not free winum matchups where uh unlike Arachne youcan disrupt a lot more and you stilllike Arachne you can just like AB ab2um all theall the room chances you have a lot ofBlues to AB stuff you can block veryefficiently and then once you disruptthis right really wants those four tofive card hands uh three card hands arelike uh at best like mob Skies intoshrill into Rosetta which is like still

good but like he's definitely not gonnahave that every time he has a three cardhand soum yeah uh he's visceral has like a veryhard time punching through and becauseyou get toum because you get to pitch to preventdamage uh he cannot really counterfatigue youum and if they're trying to run like 70plus cards to to do that you can stillkill him uh because uh you know unlikeArachne you have a real damage planwhere you just like come in with two forsix two for six uh and you smack him uhand like eventually you're gonna bechipping him down uh more efficientlythan you can chip you down if he has too

many cards so I think I think visor islike a heavily favored for uh for rosarymakes sense all right let's move on tothe last matchup okayhold on to go nextuh I don't mean like it completelyunwinnable but it's like it's got to belike in the 10 to 20 at best uh to winagainst an old him who who knows thatwho knows the matchup and who's uhplaying uh who's playing it right solike uh I did uh write up a littleummy Strat of how to be old him okay like

I feel like the one spreading plague inthe deck is uh is specifically for forhim and I think it raises like the thematchup by a couple percentage pointsbut but only by by that little soyou for for this Strat to work like youactually need the Stars to align rightso I'm bringing all 60s oh my goodnessyeah you bring in all 68 cards right solike um uh so three remembrances itmeans that you want to use two of themin the mid game to just bring back uhlike shakedowns and CNC so that you canuh so you can hit harder and then um youneed to in the mid game uh bring him to

single digit life while maintaining likeabove 12.5 yourself uh above 12 becauseyou need to eat uh two um Sledge swingsin the end game while you're doing yourlike your endgame combo uh you know youranime finisherum and that's of course incrediblydifficult uh how to do it like I I don'tknowum you just gotta do it so um yeah thisis gonna be like the hardest parthonestly yeah he's gonna be he's gonnabe sludging you a lot like you got todecide what selections you can likeblock with two cars and what whatsledges you can like block with maybe a

d react and leak two or block one cardand leak leak three uh in order to getyour uh damage in you gotta like chipwith daggersum use your uh use your vambraysufficiently and the funny thing aboutlike um ultim being on Sledge is thatbecause he doesn't have Shield hedoesn't want to Crown as much because hedoesn't want crown much your uh yourVamp race is not as effective as if hewere on Crown so it's like it's a Kindof a Funny counter Synergy thereumso uh and you kind of like you want totrack their um like their Earth reactsand and Ice reacts

um and the funny thing about ultimate isthat even if he's only on like threearms touches and like uh three winnersgrasps uh and like three clf that'sstill like a lot of ice and and Earthand in the end game it can still likefairly consistently get those Earthreacts and those uh those ice reacts uhwhen you when you need him to not haveit right yeah so uh yeah it's very hardso anyway get them down to really lowlife okay in addition to doing that youneed to generate uh two silver like onesilver is like absolute bare minimum butuh you really want to have two plussilver when you have two silver and like

you have a equipment that you've blownup for whatever reason uh do not bringit back you need two silver in the endgame otherwise your ending plan does notworkum and the the best card for getting uhsilver is and I like the armedum because uh most of his deck is a taxuh annihilate is five power uh you tryto pair it with a shred to um to endyour master partition to get uh get overum his blocks and uh get that vanish soum if you can like you land a goodannihilate with a with a master Editionthen that's too silver that's that'sthat condition complete

uh it should be 2C not 2B but memorizethe pitch locations of all of his icecards so uh the difficulty of thisvariesum it varies one because uh you knowdifferent people have differentmemorizationum like both innate ability and alsopractice because uh memorizing pitchstack is a is a is importantum high level skill that can bepracticed but of course uh you're anatural Talent at it it may varyum but also because uh different albumsrun different amount of ice and theyalso will Crown different amounts uh Ithink at high level play uh they're

probably not gonna be crowning too muchagainst your daggers uh uh many willjust accept uh one dagger hit so thatthey can you know smack you with like aspinal crush or like a pulverize orsomething right because like even thefatigue older sometimes they're justlike uh tunic pitchly Blues 14 damageincoming and then you got a block withyour whole hand and that's your turndoneum because uh you know Guardian can justdo that soum so uh this uh this uh thismemorization step um is critical for the

end game because you need to know ifthey have if they have the ability toice react you on your MasterChef returnum it's not completely mandatory becauseyou can do it like a safe play linewhere you um you don't dagger before youLD uh but it's you know it's slightlyworse so okay here's your your end gameum uh deck stack right you need to haveum a remembrance uh or a spring plagueor a lastic effort in Your Arsenal uhand then uh and then you haveum uh to empty your deck like if you uhdraw four cards and there's like one ortwo cards left in your deck uh use

silver to empty your deck so that youhave the ability to license effort okayso your five card hand is now aremembrance a spring plague um a plagueis your third yellow and then you have aelastic shepherd and a new blue card youneed three counters on on tunic uh sothat you can tune it to paper orspreading flake right if you've done allthe other prerequisites uh this is apretty easy condition to meet okay if uhso now you've been memorizing youropponent's pitch stack if they don'thave any ice cars in handum you pitch plague for spiders bite andyou pray for a blood rot like youabsolutely pray like you need to hitblood here uh then you um and then um

and then you uh like they either uhEarth react to you or they're gonna takeone uh or they block from hand which islike the best possible result but uhthen you uh uh and if they um if theycrown here to prevent your spider biteuh do not uh do not uh Vamp race becauseyou need uh all the resources in orderto build this writing plague so youpicture blue for a spreading plague youyou hope that they block with at leasttwo cars and their life is low enoughthat they need to block with at leasttwo cards and then you can uh tunic forum tunic for your spreading plague so

then all you have left is uh like a oneremembrance and uh and your um yourpitch uh in your pitch zone is like aplague Hive and a bluethen if you have at least one silverleft then your remembrance backum a elastic effort uh elastic shepherdand a Shakedownum if there's no silver left youremembers back one last of the shepherdand a Shakedown and not a third card umand then 4B if they do have ice in handum then uh or your memory is bad thenyou just LD first and then you dagger uh

and it mostly works out the same uh youpotentially miss out on a little bit ofdamage and then you remembrance and thenfinally uh if uh you drop if there's acard left in your deck your silver youjust LD immediately and then you just doit again and again uh and then uh youyou finish off with Shakedownum so it can be done I have done this intesting a few times it is very hard itis so hard to meet all the prerequisitesto actually get this old him kill uh andfrankly it does kind of require youropponent to to make some mistakes and if

you're playing opponent is playing likea top level ultim uh this this is sounlikely to to happenum but uh you know if if anyone outthere has like a better way to to killuh I told him that's you know presenting70 cards at you then please enlighten mebecause I just I just don't know abetter way yeahyeah sothis is definitely aI wish I could have seen this on streambut it is what it is this would havebeen amazing but it's definitely likethe ideal but I mean sometimes you justgotta have to play for it right so yeah

like um and also like you know everyonesays like uh uh how does this thing golike everyone has a plan until they getpunched in the face right it's likeOldham is very good at punching you inthe face right so um he and he has hisown disruption like pulverizesdisruption uh CNC Pummel is a greatdisruption uhum spinal crosses disruption and andhe's just gonna be swinging sludge a lotand you need to block with two cards toto not get uh fully fatigued so yeah avery very difficult opponentyeah so overall in the match up tier

list I feel likethings have just kind of like squished abit like I felt like a racking before itwas like maybe some more free wins but alot more go next and now it's like Ithink the only free wins were were thetwo Rangers right that was becauseRanger carpool was way worse than it isnow like if you look at if you looked atIraqi now it was like everything wouldbe shifted down it's here because likethe Rings was so much better right uhbut umso I think uh I think because uh becauseof this Squish and alsoum because of the Rangers are soprevalent in The Meta I I think it wasalready is actually a really good Meta

Meta pick even if your meta has a decentamount of ultimum and and some drone might uh just youknow praying you dodge that's a viableStrat and uh that's mostly what I didlike I played six rounds of CC I onlyrun against one ultimate which was myone loss uh it was my it was MichaelFong right who who won the whole thingso yeahum it's it's you know sometimes dodgingis a is a completely viable strategy soyeah I I think like right now I thinkRosary is even though not a tier onehero like definitely in a tier two andcompletely Bible uh you can you would uh

you know with the right amount of skillthere's uh there's there's no reason youcan Spike uh Spike some rtn events withit soall right well you heard it here folksum we could go into a tournament reportbut I think uh what I actually will wantto do is that since the video is alreadygetting a little long maybe you can justuh write that up and I would leave it inthe comments or somethingI would probably be better served forthatum but yeah any uh final words on thisdeck or any assassin or Azuri or TaoTao

fans I know people loved when you uh putthe the note on stream don't pitchattack like me yeah okay so the theironic part about that okay so eventhough we um we didn't like uh do thetournament report I think I should talkabout like the my DQ a little bit morein depth as like a kind of Coda to thisthing so that's funny because like it'sfunny you say that he's like uh don'tpitch stack like me takes on acompletely uh different meeting when yourealize that like I I literally just puta card for my pitch Zone on top of mydeck right definitely definitely don't

do that uh don't don't be like meum soum in uh in round seven uh so like my myfirst four rounds are like uh Briarwhich I win byum uh which I won by fatigue anddisruptionum Icelander which I went by fatigue uhkatsu which I win by damageum Lexi which I I went on stream uh bydamage uh and then uh three more roundsof draft so my draft strategy um I saw ared infecting shot in my pack one pickone and it was like calling my name so I

was like okay I forced Azalea and I Idid not bother reading signals oranything at all um and from what I hearfrom the other drafters that wasactually a good choice because like itwas a mixed Belgian and a Japanese packsand the signals were all over the placeso I just uh I just went with my heartand I forced this Alia uh and the way Ilike to draft and sail is likeum eight to ten Buffs and 20 arrows uhand then you know don't bother with thereaction just like dominate as much aspossible and it works pretty well um Ithink it was my first two draftopponents were like azzuri Azuri and Ijust uh dominated Arrow at both of them

um my third one was an Arachne sosimilar assassinum so like uh the game goes on for awhile I forget my own pitch stack likeby this point I'm exhausted um I this ismy fourth round on stream uh in additionto being seven rounds overallum and like I'm not tracking things likeI should be because like I'm nottracking my my own pitch stack like likeI normally wouldum I I forget that there's like blueScout periphery in my deck um I don'trealize that my opponent has pitched ayellow Razor's Edge which ends upkilling me uh and then like uh I try toBlind Azalea because my opponents have

one life I'm a two life I try to BlindAzalea for the finish and I I hit a likea the blue Scout the periphery that Itotally forgot aboutum and then and then you can watch thison the bot like if you watch the twitchVlog I think there's around like uheight hours and six minutes or somethingum I do that I end my turn and then likeuh so I I had put like a red Widowmakeron the bottom from the Azalea flip andthen instead of putting the the bluewithering shot I pitched uh on on thebottom of my deck like as you should Ijust have like the worst brain fart ofall time and I put it on top of my deck

uh and then I draw my four cards rightand so like uh if this had been um likeuh the mid game or something uh that itwouldn't really have aum like affected um like the the nextturn as much if I were blind um in Pitchdeck but actually there were exactlyfive cards left in my deck so I draw myfour the last card instead of being theblue withering shot of it should havebeen it was the red withering shot rightand like this is what gets me uh redWidowmaker right uh and red Widowmakerwhen it's dominated in a box by one card

is like seven damage whereas um whereasuh blue withering shot with a namecounter is at most four damage dominatedso like uh when um I get called by thelike the I get called over by the judgeon the following day it was like um thesecond round of CC on that day andthey're like hey uh we know we saw youon stream like uh it looks like you'recheating can you defend yourself and mydefenses were like uh one I was reallytired which obviously doesn't fly atprofessional Ariel my second defense waslike well uh weathering shot was stillwould still have been lethal becausewith an encounter uh and I can just fireit for four dominate um but still like

uh the actual fact of the matter is thatum Widowmaker would have been sevendominate right which is obviously morethan four so yeah getting a numericAdvantage there and it was reallyunfortunate that like there were exactlyfive cars left in my deck because ifthere had been four cars left I wouldjust drawn all four and it would made nodifference if there have been six cardsleft then it would have been to mydisadvantage right because like uh thenI would have had a different cardinstead of the the red Widowmaker on topwhereas if I uh like pitched it properlyand there were six cards then it wouldhave been a red Widowmaker on top solike it was just like a Confluence oflike it's really um really unfortunate

events that came together so yeah thatthat gets me disqualifiedumI think the like the judges were reallyfair uh with uh what happenedum and they uh they did try to determineintent but like determining the intentof a um like a potentially a cheatingplayer is is really difficult right yeahum because uh everything I said in mydefense uh is exactly what a cheaterwould say so like uh how do you tell itright um and according to ichin our

level two judge friend um the thepermanent policy uh if you're like kindof a 50 50 about whether a shooter is aplayer is a cheater or not um is to justdisqualify them because like the thedamage um to a tournament uh caused byhaving a cheater be in the top tables uhis far worse than the damage to theplayer by uhdisqualifying a potentially innocentplayer rightumyeah so uh it's uh is um it just uh eventhough even though it's completely Fair

disqualification still of course feelsbad uh lose out on a lot and uh if youlook at the if you look at the footagelikeum you know if you think I'm a cheaterthen uh what it comes down to is like Imake like a massive Mistake by blindAzalea Ying um uh a non-arrow uh andthen I have this like criminalmastermind genius moment of oh wait Iput this card on top instead so it's ared Widowmaker on bottom and then thefollowing turn my opponent comes in witha prowl for one damage and I don't blockand then he Razors Edge it uh so likethat's another stupid thing uh whereas

if you might think I'm innocent thenit's more of like a do a stupid thing astupid thing and then another stupidthing yeah instead of like a stupidthing genius thing and then a stupidthing soum yeah I think uh the the onlycomplaint I would have about the entirelike a judge callum uh or like the judge process uh whenI spoke with the judges is that uh whenwe were like reviewing the video footageuh they brought over their laptop and wewere on this like uh extremely shittyHot Spot internet yeah and like we werelooking at the faud and like every timewe tried to jump in the VOD at like

eight hour long VOD I was like 20seconds to load the video and it waslike 160p or something so like we couldbarely make out what cars were supposedto be uh and then all three of us werejust like getting really uh gettingreally impatient uh at this wholeprocess so uhseq if you're listeningum I don't know why uh we can't givejudges uh some some good internet uhplease do because like I know I knowthere has to be good internet somewherein the venue because like they have toupload a stream right so yeah maybe givemaybe give the judges some of thatbecause they sure could use itum but yeah that's uh that's pretty much

how that went down uh and then like thefollowing day uh another draft uh mypick one pick one is like a lace withblood rot so okay okay I guess I'mforcing Azalea again I do the exact samething again go to one againum my my one loss was to Missouri whohad like a bunch of armor like everysingleum reaction and then uh damageprevention effect uh so a nice littletwo one there and then I go intoum the CC rounds uh my first round wasagainstum hashemir on Lexi uh and I think heplayed a lot better than theum the Lexi from day one but uh he still

makes some some critical mistakes in thelate game uh that end up costing him soI win that one uh my uh my next round isagainst uh Michael Fung on Old himum and he uh is like we were both tryingto play fast but he was clearly like notvery well experienced in the uh Azurematchup becauseum he he got like a couple of uh gameroll violation warnings that game wherehe was like I isolate and then uh heblocks with a car from hand and then Iactivate Zuri and before that it was

really resolves he paper scenes and helooks at the top car and he's like ohwait I can't do that uh and then likelater I backstab him and then iizure andhe's like I I staunch in response uh andI said no you can't de-react to backstaband then I flip into a CNC and you can'tdeep react to that either so like I dosix damage too so uh that was like theHighlight turn however uh uh all thatreally means is that instead of any ofthe game at 15 life he ends the game atlike nine life souh yeah uh Oldham old him being old him

like he you know he was a lot of fewmistakes and uh it's still like the deckmatchup is he like all of them's just somuch better against Missouri uh thanthan everything else somakes sense all right and uh I guessthat wraps up everything if I had to addsomething it would be um I can uhpersonally vouch for TaoTao as a localback in the day like I've never seensomebody so quickly call a judge onthemselves at like uh an rtn as TaoTaoso ah thanks I appreciate that and uhfor for those of you uh uh watching at

home uh feel free to watch the uh uhwatch the VOD of the uh the switchstream and uh you know judge foryourself in the in the court of publicopinion I'm curious to hear yourthoughts yeah so if this changes youropinion on TaoTao it is what it is heprobably doesn't care butyeah that's also trueso yeahum yeah thanks for coming on TaoTao thisDeck Tech was uh long as expected not aslong as our previous one hopefullyum so yeah so hopefully any Azuri fansthat want to play the contract style can

uh pick this up for rtnum any closing words before we sign offno I think I I just like I reallyencourage anyone who thinks this deck iscool to pick her up and uh even thoughlike there are a lot of expensive cardsuh in there like a tunics CNCum uh even though maybe CNC can't bereplaced by budget like you couldreplace a tunic with a with a heart andcross strap and you can place CNC withuh some some more two for sixes and uhyou still have like an actual deck thatI think can can still Tango uh with alot of the top decks of the format and

uh Missouri is very fun to play um thisdeck is very difficult to play as welluh and I I expectum I expect you know a lot offrustration if you're trying to go leantoo hard into one game plan or the otherum even though it's a fatigue style deckuh you cannot win by just like walkingout with your entire hand because uh uhbecause decks can go wide if you'retrying to block out everything youshould be playing ultim instead whereasuh the actual fatigue style you shouldbe playing is like walking away withsome of your hand doing efficient a oneor two card hands do efficient likeArsenal flips uh and uh and winning

through attrition that way uh and it's avery it's a very delicate a Razor's Edgeto balance ironically enough and I thinkit's a really rewarding playstyle tomaster if you uh if you get good at itso I I strongly recommend giving thisdeck a whirl and seeing how you do allright thanks Town town and um yeah Iguess that's uh that's all from us saybye YouTube
