For other uses, see [Metric (disambiguation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(disambiguation)).

**Router metrics** are configuration values used by a [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)) to make routing decisions. A *metric* is typically one of many fields in a [routing table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table). Router metrics help the router choose the best route among multiple feasible routes to a destination. The route will go in the direction of the gateway with the lowest metric.

A router metric is typically based on information such as [path length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_(networking)), [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)), [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)), [hop count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_count), path cost, [delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_delay), [maximum transmission unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit) (MTU), [reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking)) and communications cost.

#### Examples

A metric can include:

* measuring link utilization (using SNMP)
* number of hops ([hop count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_count))
* speed of the path
* packet loss (router congestion/conditions)
* [Network delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_delay)
* path reliability
* path [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing))
* throughput [SNMP - query routers]
* [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing))
* [Maximum transmission unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit) (MTU)
* administrator configured value

In [EIGRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIGRP), metrics is represented by an integer from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (The size of a 32-bit integer). In [Microsoft Windows XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_XP) routing it ranges from 1 to 9999.

A metric can be considered as:1(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrics_(networking)#cite_note-1)

* additive - the total cost of a path is the sum of the costs of individual links along the path,
* concave - the total cost of a path is the minimum of the costs of individual links along the path,
* multiplicative - the total cost of a path is the product of the costs of individual links along the path.

#### Service level metrics

Router metrics are metrics used by a router to make routing decisions. It is typically one of many fields in a routing table.

Router metrics can contain any number of values that help the router determine the best route among multiple routes to a destination. A router metric typically based on information like path length, bandwidth, load, hop count, path cost, delay, MTU, reliability and communications cost.
