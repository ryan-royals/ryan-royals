For every country, the Directory lists the hosting providers that provided evidence to us of their green services. To be listed in the Green Web Directory is a free service for [green hosting providers that can be identified through AS numbers and/or IP ranges](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/what-you-need-to-register/).
