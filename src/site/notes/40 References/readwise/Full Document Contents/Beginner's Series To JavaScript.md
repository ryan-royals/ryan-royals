**Beginner's guide to JavaScript on Node.js**

Learning a new framework or development environment is made even more difficult when you don't know the programming language. Fortunately, we're here to help! We've created this series of videos to focus on the core concepts of JavaScript.

While we don't cover every aspect of JavaScript, we will help you build a foundation from which you can continue to grow. By the end of this series, you'll be able to work through tutorials, quick starts, books, and other resources, continuing to grow on your own.

The video series is designed to be consumed as you see fit. You can watch from start to finish, or you can dive into specific topics. You can always bookmark and come back as you need.
