We're excited to announce changes that make [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) even better for hosting your wiki, knowledge base, documentation, or digitalÂ garden.

##### What's new?

* 50% lower price. Publish now costs the same as [Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) at $96 per year, or $10 per month (USD)
* Faster and more accessible. Publish now has near 100% Lighthouse scores on performance, SEO, accessibility, and best practices
* Improved search engine indexing
* Pretty social sharing cards, customizable using YAML metadata
* Customize which pages appear in the sidebar and in which order

If you missed it, we also recently released [a new default theme for Obsidian Publish](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/publish-theming-guide/54445) that is more accessible and customizable.
