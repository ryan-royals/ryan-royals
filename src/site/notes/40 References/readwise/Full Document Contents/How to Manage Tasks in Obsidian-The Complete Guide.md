![A simple checklist.](https://obsidian.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/thomas-bormans-pcpsVsyFp_s-unsplash.jpg)
Managing projects and tasks in Obsidian may seem odd.

Obsidian is not a task manager, it’s a note-taking application. Why would we manage tasks in Obsidian when there are so many other apps specifically *made* for managing tasks?

It’s a good question.

I’ve used dozens of to-do apps over the years, but I’ve never found one that really clicked with me. They’re either too simple, which means I can’t effectively plan my projects in the app. Or they’re too complex, and I eventually stop using them because it’s too much of a pain to maintain.

So on a whim, I decided to try to manage my projects in Obsidian.

And surprisingly, I love it. I manage everything in my work and life in Obsidian now, and it works better than any to-do app I’ve ever tried. (including apps that I paid hundreds of dollars for)

#### Why is Obsidian Great for Projects?

Obsidian is so *flexible* and *versatile*, if you *want* to manage projects and tasks in Obsidian, it has some *huge* advantages over a traditional task manager. For instance:

* You can embed tasks in any note, allowing you to organize projects however you like
* You can link related notes together, allowing you to keep things clean but still accessible
* You can keep track of your progress via custom dashboards or Daily Notes
* You can create visualizations in Obsidian that may be hard (or impossible) to do in another tool
* If you already spend a lot of time in Obsidian, it’s handy to have everything in one place

But there are a couple of downsides as well:

* Obsidian doesn’t have push notifications
* Managing tasks effortlessly requires a few community plugins. These plugins are free, but they add some complexity to the process.

If you’re curious about creating a digital bullet journal, or a Life Operating System, setting up tasks in Obsidian might be a great fit for you.

#### Recommended Plugins for Managing Tasks

If you want to try using tasks in Obsidian, there are a few plugins I recommend:

All four of these are community plugins. [Learn how to use community plugins](https://obsidian.rocks/how-to-use-community-plugins-in-obsidian/).

#### Adding Completed Tasks to Daily Notes

Do you use [Daily Notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) in Obsidian?

I’ve kept an daily journal for over a decade now, and I find it tremendously helpful to look back on the progress I’ve made in life and work.

But a lot gets lost between the lines of my journals. I often write about the progress I’ve made on a project, but as time goes on, I forget the details. One way to add more context to your journals *without* adding any more effort is to keep a log of your daily to-dos *inside* the journal.

Best of all, if you’re already using Daily Notes and the tasks plugin, this only requires a single line of code.

You can learn how to do that here: [How to Add Tasks to your Daily Notes in Obsidian](https://obsidian.rocks/how-to-add-tasks-to-your-daily-notes/)

#### Creating a Today view in Obsidian

If your work involves deadlines, or you struggle to keep track of projects within Obsidian, you’re going to love this next tip.

I created a “Today” view in my Obsidian vault, and it automatically generates a plan for me to follow every day. It really frees my mind to focus on *important* work without having to think about or remember the repetitive work I do. If that sounds interesting to you, see this tip:
