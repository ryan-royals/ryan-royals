this is the class that breaks the economy in dark and darker and I'm going to show you the strategies that I Implement on the Rogue to get gold consistently with very little risk or investment in fact all you need to get started is a pickaxe from The Woodsman some smoke bombs to get away from any enemies chasing you a skeleton key AKA lockpicking Mastery to loot all the valuable chests nearby and a lifetime of training to learn how to jump in thin air AKA double jump and lastly Shadow Runner to give you a speed boost to make 

parkour easier and don't forget meds otherwise you'll be gifting all of your loot to the Swarm every time so there are three gold spawns that we want to try and hit every run one in the middle of the map one at the bottom left and one at the top left luckily in this game I got to spawn right next to Mid map so I quickly head to the only statue with two hands and interact with it so I can open the entrance to the gold door all right get that gold baby 

all right we're going to want to go to the graveyard next you got to make sure that you're crouching down when you're going through here otherwise you're going to die almost every time trust me and easy gold let's hit it and cuz we got lockpicking Mastery we're going to hit all of these gold chests that we see oh that's pretty nice actually right make sure nobody's up top we can get out of here super easy just by jumping on that little crate I just heard somebody 

oh my God he's right stuck no peace boy now we go top left and it 

should be easy cuz it looks like Storm's in there once you come in here there's going to be three bats to kill never mind it's already been cleared it looks like but there's a guaranteed gold or spawn back here in this corner that you're going to want to get every time pop a couple bandages so we're good on health pop another one of these let's get this gold and then we'll hit the static and we're good baby all right now we just got to pop some meds make sure we don't die in the storm and we can get on out of here baby 

I actually forgot about this lion's head we got to hit this real quick take it all why not a heavy ornate purple Shield let's go baby all right now we're getting out of here oh my God that's more gold bro holy [Music] sh can't believe we just got more let me check this one real quick ah all right now I'm out make sure I don't die on the way out cuz I Agro this dog 

let's go baby let's go baby if you keep doing this you'll never have to worry about being broken dark and darker ever again
