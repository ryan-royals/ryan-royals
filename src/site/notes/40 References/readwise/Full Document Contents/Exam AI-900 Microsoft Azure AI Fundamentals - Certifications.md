This exam is an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) concepts and related Microsoft Azure services. Candidates for this exam should have familiarity with Exam AI-900’s self-paced or instructor-led learning material.

This exam is intended for candidates with both technical and non-technical backgrounds. Data science and software engineering experience are not required; however, awareness of cloud basics and client-server applications would be beneficial.

Azure AI Fundamentals can be used to prepare for other Azure role-based certifications like Azure Data Scientist Associate or Azure AI Engineer Associate, but it is not a prerequisite for any of them.

You may be eligible for ACE college credit if you pass this certification exam. See [ACE college credit for certification exams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/ace-credit-for-certification-exams) for details.
