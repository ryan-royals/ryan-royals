[Music] foreign [Music] Community College viewers asked the question what does the professor want in a TCG product I spend a lot of my time on this channel reviewing products trying to help you spend your dollars wisely and a rare thing has happened where a company actually wants to hear my voice and my input to get you the kind of TCG product that I would want to 

play with that would be my dream product a product for everyone and this is that product Legend story Studios creators of flesh and blood came to me over one year ago and asked that very question what is the product that the professor wants we talked about everything that I felt would make a great product and The Talented Minds that LSS worked and revised and then in discussing with me further revised again 

and then revised a few more times and finally came up with this round the table a product designed in collaboration with me the professor and I am so happy that I get to show this off to you right now round the table is a flesh and blood product designed with multiplayer in mind specifically flesh and blood's casual multiplayer format ultimate pit fight inside of it are four brand new pre-constructed Blitz decks probably 

some of the most powerful Blitz deck designs ever made featuring original hero designs as well as a young Professor teclavasan done in an alternate art style that is very evocative of another professor with his Geek Chic three-piece suits retro academic hutier and of course his colorful socks I'm on a card me this is really so exciting and so humbling to be part of a game I I honestly feel overwhelmed by the whole thing I'm so 

grateful and honored to forever be a part of flesh and blood but this isn't just putting my likeness on a card and calling it a day James White the creator of Flesh and Blood was adamant that his goal was to create a product that I was proud of and truth be told the initial idea they brought to me was not one that I liked right they'll surprise like at all but James and lead designer Brian Gottlieb continued to work with me to get my input and feedback and further feedback on ideas and through a very 

long process again this has been in the works for well over a year now we not only have a product that I am proud of and excited by but one that I'm willing to put my name and likeness on round the table is four pre-constructed Blitz decks in a single product these decks are playable right out of the box and bring a host of original card designs as well as reprints to the game round the table also comes with a high quality neoprene mat remember my old video 

review where I complained that the play mat they included in their flesh blood product it's just a piece of paper here we have an actual play mat high quality with just gorgeous stunning artwork inside are four Blitz decks if you've watched my previous videos you know just how much I love Blitz decks they usually sell for only about 14.95 each but they're fully playable right out of the box pre-constructed Decks that are balanced really well against one another and can be used to play against your friends who maybe are already established in flesh and blood and here 

we have original hero designs that do things that no other Heroes have done before including a certain Professor Blitz deck which I'll get to in just a moment but it wouldn't be a talarian community college video if I didn't obsess over the Box itself hey it's my brand and what better box than this one where the insert comes out and converts it into an archival storage box thick corrugated cardboard a beautiful art design and you can now store your collection your Blitz deck boxes all right here in this box and if you've 

been watching my channel for a long time you know how much I love this style of archival storage box with the tuck in flaps but what's so clever here is that after you've taken out your play mat and the four pre-constructed Blitz decks you just take that little insert out don't need that anymore and now here you go store your cards stores sleeved cards put your decks in here or if you're like me and you collect Blitz decks because these are just some of the best products flesh and blood makes playable right out of the box 14.95 or so each and they just go right in there along 

with your cards your card collection fantastic but these Blitz decks aren't like any that have come before them well of course they can be played 1v1 or upgraded the real exciting thing is that they are filled with multiplayer relevant card designs I got to share a lot of my thoughts with LSS about ultimate pit fight and some of the things that I wish you could do in the format and a lot of these original card designs are a reflection of that in the coming weeks we'll do a full deck list review for these Blitz decks and of 

course an in-depth analysis is it worth it to buy Style video as well but what exactly are you getting in these Blitz decks and why are they like no other and what exactly does my card and the other hero cards do like any other mechanologist the professor is based around boosting but unlike any other mechanologist Heroes you can still get value out of the key cards you accidentally boost away that is because the professor can play EVO cards from the banished Zone the more 

evos you have equipped the more access you have to cool actions and abilities on your turn his strengths are dishing out damage and dealing with whoever the threat at the table is that's right but the professor's tecloscope you can attack and Target anyone at the table not just the person sitting to your left and right round the table will also introduce us to the first legal Bard hero Melody and like bards tend to be she's both unique and a little op Melody lets you play song cards you get to play 

songs action cards that benefit every other player at the table but like any artist who knows her worth Melody doesn't work for exposure so every time you play a song you get a copper for every other hero in the game have you ever wanted to hug get everyone at the table to death while Melody will keep playing songs until she's ready to pull off her final Act cashing in all those coppers to fill up your pitch Zone and deal massive damage brevent a guardian hero is one of the first Guardians in the game who actually wants to protect 

someone else looking at you Bravo revant is going to show him how chivalry is really done because brevand can have any number of chivalries in his deck chivalry is a guardian block card with the keyword protect which allows you to defend for any Hero at the table every time you protect Another Hero brevent gets a might token boosting your first attack for the next turn Brevin creates an environment where you can politic to protect other players taking that turn to set up and then Smash in with the medius meet stick there is again sorry 

Bravo we also have a returning face Ira who you may remember from the original Flesh and Blood welcome decks but here she's a complete Blitz deck and it's not just for beginners anymore taking Advan advantage of the Crouching Tiger tokens from Dynasty she looks to combo off and make any turn work in her favor through high damage low-cost versatility with nearly any set of cards in hand you can make a combo happen and punch through to do some serious damage again the full 

deck lists will be revealed in the coming weeks and you can expect among a few other surprises and is it worth it to buy detailed analysis on round the table as well I am so lucky that I was able to be a part of this I understand what a privilege it is to have had a voice at the table this is a responsibility I take seriously and if you know me from my reviews then you know how much I want products that just let players gather together and enjoy the game products that have new card designs and cool reprints as well as 

something for established players while still being something that is great for people brand new to the game and I really feel this is that product a product for everyone for people who already know and love and play Flesh and Blood to those looking to get into the game or looking to get their friends or even kids into Flesh and Blood this is that product a product that players of all kinds can pick up and gather to play with round the table in person in flesh 

and blood and of course it's available only at your local game store because you know me the second they said what's your dream product I said it's something that gets people into local game stores something that's available at local game stores and that philosophy is so point in point with LSS and James White and everything that the Flesh and Blood game is about and speaking of local game stores flesh and blood's pre-release events are taking place worldwide right now at them the newest set Bright Lights is pre-releasing September 29th through 

October 2nd I'll provide links in this video's description but the best bet is just to go into your local game store and see what events they are playing in flesh and blood and maybe let them know if you're interested than picking up a copy of round the table so that you and your friends can get some games of flesh and blood in Flesh and Blood whether that's at home or at your local game store I always end by saying I hope very much this video like all of my videos has been of some help to you and I also 

End by saying that when it is possible when it is reasonable to do so you should spend your time where you spend playing these great games and that's at your local game store for this video I hope very much this product is of some joy to you some fun to you and that you can pick it up at your local game store and get some games in Flesh and Blood round the table [Music] thank you
