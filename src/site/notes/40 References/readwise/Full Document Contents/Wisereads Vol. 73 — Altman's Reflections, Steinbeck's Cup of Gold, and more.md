Last week, we shared the entirety of *Learn More Faster* by Michael Margolis of Google Ventures, a guide on tackling user research at startups. This week, we're sharing John Steinbeck's first novel, *Cup of Gold*, which follows the fearsome pirate Captain Morgan and just became public domain in the U.S.

Sam Altman ¬∑ blog.samaltman.com

On the second anniversary of ChatGPT‚Äôs release, OpenAI founder Sam Altman calls that day a pivotal moment for AI, bringing us closer than ever to AGI and superintelligence. "We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents 'join the workforce' and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes."

Chris Hayes ¬∑ The New York Times

News anchor Chris Hayes recognizes that attention is fleeting, yet points out that people sought distraction from their own minds long before smartphones. "While the state of constant interruption of the attention age may be unwelcome, it grows from a desire that long predates contemporary life. 'When I have occasionally set myself to consider the different distractions of men,' Pascal observed in 'PenseÃÅes,' his collection of essays published in 1670, 'I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber.'"

After spending a few weeks at DOGE, Loom founder Vinay Hiremath booked a one-way ticket to Hawaii to study physics, hoping to confront his insecurities and burning questions. "Why do I feel the need to only be on a journey if it‚Äôs grand? What is wrong with being insignificant? Why is letting people down so hard?"

#####  [Do you really need to take 10,000 steps a day?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEWa7cpiyD8)

TED-Ed x Shannon Odell

Debunking the typical "10,000 steps a day" advice, comedian and scientist Shannon Odell explains how adding any amount of walking can yield major health benefits. "Carrying the weight of your body as you walk places stress on the bones. But this stress actually makes the bones stronger, as it stimulates the absorption of calcium and minerals. That's why years of consistent walking can help retain bone density, which usually declines with age. Building a lifelong walking habit comes with many other benefits, from aiding in weight management to reducing your risk for type 2 diabetes, numerous cancers, and dementia."

I thought I was crazy until I found Richard Feynman.

Feynman was not only among the most brilliant people on earth, but he transmitted something I've never seen in others.

Thread with some lessons from his peculiar way of being:

Giuliano

When he‚Äôs not reading, Giuliano writes viral tweets drawn from his favorite books and history‚Äôs notable figures. Among his takeaways from theoretical physicist Richard Feynman: "You don't understand what 'first principles' really mean until you listen to a physicist reasoning. It's about going to the end of the world chasing a chain of 'whys'," and "There is another real loss in life: The loss of one's sense of humor. It doesn't matter how many labels, prestige, and wisdom you may have. You don't want to go through life without laughing."

#### Most highlighted PDF of the week

#####  [Agents](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/wisereads/articles/agents/Newwhitepaper_Agents2.pdf)

Julia Wiesinger, Patrick Marlow and Vladimir Vuskovic

What are the makings of an agent? Google‚Äôs whitepaper likens an agent‚Äôs cognitive architecture to a busy chef, composed of a model, orchestration layer, and tools to interface with the outside world. "Imagine a chef in a busy kitchen. Their goal is to create delicious dishes for restaurant patrons which involves some cycle of planning, execution, and adjustment... At each stage in the process the chef makes adjustments as needed, refining their plan as ingredients are depleted or customer feedback is received, and uses the set of previous outcomes to determine the next plan of action."

#### Hand-picked book of the week

#####  [Cup of Gold](https://readwise.io/reader/fd/259218820)

John Steinbeck

Long before *The Grapes of Wrath* or *East of Eden*, John Steinbeck‚Äôs debut set sail with the treacherous pirate Captain Morgan in *Cup of Gold*. At first glance, it‚Äôs a swashbuckling pirate tale, but tucked within the adventure is a reflection on how the thrill of pursuit compares with the reality of achievement.

"Captain Morgan went back to the treasure. He sat on the floor and took the coins into his hands. 'The most human of all human traits is inconsistency,' he thought. 'It is a shock to learn this thing, almost as great a shock to a man as the realization of his humanity. And why must we learn that last? In all the mad incongruity, the turgid stultiloquy of life, I felt, at least, securely anchored to myself. Whatever the vacillations of other people, I thought myself terrifically constant. But now, here I am, dragging a frayed line, and my anchor gone.'"

This edition of [*Cup of Gold*](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-steinbeck/cup-of-gold) is available through Standard Ebooks. In celebration of Public Domain Day in the U.S., they‚Äôve added twenty new titles to their meticulously formatted and free ebook collection [here](https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2025).

#####  [Max Woolf's Blog](https://minimaxir.com/post/index.xml)

Senior Data Analyst at BuzzFeed, Max Woolf, reports on his experiments with AI on his blog. From [Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to "write better code"?](https://wise.readwise.io/save?url=https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/): "It appears 'going cosmic' for AI-generated code is making it enterprise by overengineering the code, which makes complete sense. Despite that, the code runs as-is without any bugs... after benchmarking, the algorithm is extremely fast, resulting in about 6 milliseconds a run, or a 100x speedup. My assumption that this prompting was hitting diminishing returns aged very poorly. Maybe numba was the secret all along?"
