#### Azure AI is transforming business across sectors

Modernizing apps is a crucial step for organizations aiming to stay relevant in a fast-evolving AI landscape, as legacy apps often struggle to meet modern performance, scalability, and security standards. In fact, a [2024 Forrester study](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-forrester-unlock-competitive-advantage-with-app-mod.html) found that one in four business decision makers said their organization experiences digital platform failures because of their modernization challenges.

By refactoring or re-platforming legacy apps with cloud-native Azure tools, businesses can unlock improved flexibility, faster development cycles, and more efficient operations. According to the [Forrester study](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-forrester-unlock-competitive-advantage-with-app-mod.html), 89% of decision makers surveyed said their firm plans to increase or at least maintain their current application modernization investments over the next year to achieve key priorities and address modernization gaps.

Azure provides a comprehensive set of tools and services to enable businesses to build new application and modernize existing app and data estate, with an intelligent application platform, cloud-scale databases, Azure AI Services, and Azure Machine Learning. These enable the creation of intelligent apps that leverage real-time, cloud-scale data and advanced analytics. Cloud-native apps on Azure benefit from features such as auto-scaling, microservices, and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring high performance and cost-effectiveness.

Let’s meet some of the many Azure customers who have not only been able to differentiate their business in the market and accelerate product innovation by building new, AI-powered intelligent apps, but also skill their teams with the latest learning resources from Azure designed for adopting AI applications.
