hey guys this is my real guide for dummies explaining the Bare Essentials for you guys especially mobs loot when to fight and where and how especially things like insurance policies of like how to escape uh starting out with your skills you want to be bringing hide in smoke bomb if you're not level 15 yet because if you do not have four products you will have a horrible time for level one make sure to bring poison to weapon this will help you deal with your mobs easier when you're just starting out and uh you'll be able to clear things relatively quickly to be 

able to get the loot at level 5 pick up stealth so you're able to get out of situations just a teeny bit better with 10 steps so you can walk in some random directions and prey and timing this game is everything and the teeny bit of movement speed is worth it especially when they don't know where you're going at level 10 pick up Ambush at this point you can trade out smoke bomb for rupture and start to try to kill people if you want it's a little easier with a jump scare at level taught I love level times at level 15 make sure you recycle that entire build and pick up everything I 

have here you have jokester for the plus two attributes buff this will buff your strength agility and resourcefulness which basically helps your interaction time movement speed weapon swinging and also just bear damage it's very good Shadow Runner gives you extra movement speed when coming out of hide this is good for double jump spamming and being able to catch your target like basically not a clue that you're there and get there quickly you'll see that in the video uh this is also good for chugging invis potions because it also procs your Ambush which gives you more damage after 

50 after 50 it gives you 50 more additional weapon damage when coming out of stealth which is why weak point is so good if you have gear and double jump for kiting mobs getting to unreachable areas unpredictable locations and saving time cutting players such as Rangers Wizards and Fighters with crossbows and bows and arrows if you have gear make sure to run a weak point or you'll never kill Fighters or clerics refer to my rogue guide in the description if you want more information on the best and Slot stats because I'm 

not gonna go over them here if you have weaker gear that's when you run rupture as you will kill much more be able to burst the target more effectively now that we are done with this [ \_\_ ] let's get into a game and show you how to actually play and kill people as easily as possible if you think about it being a solo Rogue player is like just being like a Ryan Gosling Sigma so 

foreign 

guys drop bandages and meds necklaces pendants Rings everything that you need always make sure you kill zombies zombies drop your loot well obviously they drop your boot but they drop you armor pieces that you need for when you're just starting especially if you don't have anything if you don't have a Rapier Escape once you'll be fine Trust 

it's PBE a very easy zombies can only burp first so you can get free hits in see I already have additional move speed [ \_\_ ] zombies will always burp first I always get free hits in that seems scary but they always fly in One Direction always Loop left scared to hit them to make them kill themselves 

by messing them all up in one big Zone these guys also drop your bandages and pendants which are very important they also drop lanterns but you can sell for actually a lot of gold see there's one really good blended sell these for quite a bit so may as well take them until you find something else you build one instead 

ow get lazy might get hit once lanterns as well sell for 10 a piece more Excel for 30 the higher the tier this room is top priority if you can get here first they can clear it quickly this room is next which is pretty crazy 

it always spawn Exquisite items you want to get here first if you can depending on the way you've come there might be a skeleton here always Fade Out a swing boom easy again if you're just starting out box pin didn't spawn here everything spawns here you need push for something don't be scared of these guys literally just run some circles around them 

make sure you always have an escape tap towards the door you came from very unlikely that someone's gonna timing you and be going the other side of this obviously it can happen but that's why you don't close the doors behind you so you can come through a door like this and Escape you need to these guys drop gems you need gems this is how you farm them I think Hyrule is a waste of time through the clips of me dying in high roller is 

this is where double jump comes into play the reason why I use an invisible here is so I can get the shadowrunner proc for free without having to use my actual hide and then I catch up to him using double jump It's good to use double jump to get Space because they can't hear your footsteps and you can sneak up on them like this it's very good very worthwhile 

all right oh hell potion's been fight to get killed a lot easier see wipe double jumping always will make you get to them faster and have less footsteps 

it used to be worth to not run double jump but nowadays I mean someone went to the bat room that I was here from oh there's somebody in that corner I get jump scared by a road get to gg well played hey the great sword guys a few slings another one and sometimes they stop 

one two somebody else below as I said before keeping all your doors open and knowing your Escape path is a good way of having an insurance policy just in case you do need to run as I do here uh fighting a cleric almost impossible when they haven't judged in the building off cooldown if he was a little bit more alone I could have bursted him there with my weak point and he would have died instantly but I didn't get the chance to because it was spider friend uh that's almost 

unkillable so I kind of back up at this point fighting any of these people is suicide I was just doing it for fun and trying to BM even though I had a full inventory yes 

okay before we get into the next raid we're just going to go over shrines and everything and how to actually play the map correctly uh and like get into unwinnable scenarios how to actually Escape them I want to go over what you can actually buy here that's important uh in game you can get these hand crossbows that are really good for procking your weak point and doing chip damage especially if you have rupture it does proc on this uh the weaponsmith you will have a white Rapier or like even a gray one for like 10 gold it is worth buying immediately the Rapier is the best weapon in the game I cannot reiterate this enough any other dagger 

is absolute garbage there's no point you will die to everything it's just there's no point in having it bolts in here or 10 it's not that expensive these pendants you'll find rings are a little bit harder to find like instances you will find very easily this is very like average gear like I have my God set in here that I'm not gonna use yet but that's the next video so subscribe for that I'm just saying like the video you know really appreciate it actually just hit 300 Subs I'm really surprised you guys are [ \_\_ ] nuts by the way uh I 

might do a live stream soon if this video hits uh 150 likes I'll do live streaming solo Rogue commentary training advice I don't [ \_\_ ] know but let's get into the next game because no one's here to listen to me ramble ramble rambling [Music] okay dealing with Mobs against they go to library spawn let me help you with this you see this Mage watch this aim down Crouch down oh okay well I lied to you my bad uh anyway that didn't happen anyway uh 

great start I'm editing that out that I'm Healed sorry I kind of got ganked by three players I had to kill them real quick oh it's a person above me yeah sorry I had to kill some players real quick they were getting on my nerves I didn't get fire involved by a wizard trying to show you guys anything or anything that'd be cringe 

okay speed shrines important it's actually dead here but I'm not going to be foreign 

this is what I call Shrine rotations they can't do anything about this I can just basically DM them this entire time it's very easy to play the map when you know exactly where everything is and what you're doing I know I have these doors open over here so even if they were to chase me I just jump on the other side and I can't do anything at this point I know there's some Escape 

photos around so I'm gonna try to play the map and I'm trying to push deeper into Zone from the opposite side of that team because I know they're insanely strong thank you if you look in the top right especially 

if you're not doing High Roller you can see how many players are left I know there's still a few trios left in this Lobby and I know there's one right here I tried to kill the ranger but it didn't quite work out and I almost got body blocked if I didn't have double jump I definitely die here dude what the [ \_\_ ] is this I'm better at the game but this is all just happening I should have pushed left here and I should have rotated around the Zone but instead I kind of [ \_\_ ] up and I just went through this door and then almost died and then the door wouldn't close 

this is 

thankfully I know that this speech ride's gone but I know the mobs here are still alive so I know that the other team went through the other door instead of chasing me from before so I know that 

I'm safe to grab this house right here for free since Barbarian can't break down jail doors thank God the entire team ends up getting a wiped but I know there's still a lot of people alive and I can't like give up yet because there's a lot of traffic on the map and they're all being pushed in this one area I don't mind enough 

yo the support on the videos have been insane I appreciate whoever's made it this far you know I hope this guide has taught you something of importance especially if you're struggling I hope it taught you what to think about how to play the map a little bit and what you should be looting to try and make it a little bit easier for yourself Rogue in 

my opinion is one of the worst classes in the game right now because of how brain dead every other class is but Rogue if you [ \_\_ ] up you're dead man it's kind of how it is anyway I appreciate you all uh we all have a great rest of your day good luck in the dungeon make me proud okay please I'm begging I'm begging out here uh but yeah video tomorrow one shot Rogue I knew and I called it
