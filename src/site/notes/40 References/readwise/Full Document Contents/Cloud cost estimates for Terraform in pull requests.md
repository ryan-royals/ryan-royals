#### Show the cloud cost of each Infrastructure change in CI/CD

##### Team lead visibility across changes

When using Infracost in CI/CD, team leads, managers & FinOps can see pull requests that increase or decrease costs the most, by how much, and by whom.

This helps you better understand when & where cost changes were introduced, as well as upcoming changes.
