Andrej Karpathy is a researcher and a founding team member at OpenAI. From 2017 to 2022, he was the Director of AI at Tesla, leading the computer vision team for Tesla Autopilot. He received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford, where he developed early multimodal deep neural networks that processed both images and text, for example, for image captioning applications.He was also the primary instructor for CS231n, the first deep learning class at Stanford, which he designed, and which went on to become one of the largest classes in the AI curriculum.
