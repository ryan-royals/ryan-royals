this is the most evil the most disturbing in the darkest episode we have ever released on the Sean Ryan Show it has to do with Predators who are praying sexually on children Ryan Montgomery the number one ranked ethical hacker in the world has dedicated his life 

to hacking into these websites and exposing the Predators who are preying on our children to the world and he has thousands and thousands of names now that he's releasing this is going to save a lot of kids and I want you to share this with everybody you know the public needs to be informed of this 

and here's how the kids are going to be saved because everybody says oh share my stuff right here's how they'll be saved every parent that watches this smarten up on what their kids doing on the internet every kid that watches this is going to smarten up and become aware of how prevalent this stuff is on the internet and every one of you predators that's watching this it's going to put the fear of God into you because when you're caught 

you will be humiliated and hopefully in prison that's how this is going to save these kids people are going to smarten up they're going to realize this is everywhere this is on every social media platform every chat room everywhere you go on the internet these people are hanging out and unfortunately we have to fight censorship here because here's one thing these Predators have a lot of powerful 

people throughout the world and government in Hollywood all over the place that are sticking up for this community so we've done everything we possibly can to avoid censorship we have demonetized it ourselves this isn't about money this isn't about advertising this is about saving kids and that's it so we've demonetized the video ourself we've 

pulled footage we've bleeped every bad word on this video in hopes that it does not get censored because the masses and the people need to watch this now this is a battle between good and evil and I can tell you right now good is losing unless people like you start to stand up 

and get loud about this subject this isn't about politics this isn't even about the country this is about kids all over the world this is happening please pay attention and share this with everyone you know if you want to see the unedited stuff it'll be on my patreon and it will be on Rumble in a few days in patreon like I said we demonetize this one you 

you alone or who's making this possible so thank you for the support because if it wasn't for you this wouldn't be happening with that being said I want to just say Ryan Montgomery I'm real proud to know you man and it was a real honor to have you in here and get this interview and educate the world 

on what you're doing and how these predators are reaching our kids and it's an honor to be your friend thank you one last thing if you did get anything out of this please take 10 seconds out of your day and go to Spotify and go to Apple podcast and leave us a review and tell us what you got out of this that helps the algorithm push these episodes farther 

you get more reach and this is the subject everybody needs to hear thank you [Music] [Music] 

foreign [Music] [Music] 

[Music] Montgomery welcome to the Sean Ryan Show van thank you for having me it's an honor to have you so I found you I found a a maybe a 30-second short on Instagram and we'll get into that later of you 

exposing I believe it was a father who was exploiting his daughter in a bathtub you would hacked in and exploited that and so I reached out thinking there's no way in hell this guy's gonna give me the time of day because it doesn't look like you're very active on the on the gram and then yeah and then I got you yeah so I'm like I'm just super excited to be here uh interviewing you right now dude you are just you are doing amazing things 

saving who knows how many kids you know I mean if you think of the impact of what you're doing you know we'll get into it you'll never know the full impact of how many kids that you've saved by kids smartening up about what they're doing online parents smartening up about what their kids are doing online and these pedophiles you're going to put the fear of God in them oh for sure and so that's the goal there's going to be less of them preying on on on these kids so 

anyways we'll get into all that stuff I just wanted to say I'm how excited I am likewise I'm very excited to be here and uh it means the world to me and and uh especially that the the reach that you have the amount of parents that will be educated based on some of the stuff that we talk about here even if we save one kid it's worth it yes so let me give you a little bit of an intro here you're the number one ranked ethical hacker in the 

world you're a Serial entrepreneur cyber security professional and now a child safety warrior with your company 561 PC uh not my com 561 PC is not a company my company is actually pen tester which is a cyber security company.com 561 PC is an organization that that I created with my friend Dustin labros or Scrappy's a professional MMA fighter we'll get into that soon and your goal protecting 

children and trying to make South Florida and the world a better place by catching one child predator at a time that's that's a damn good goal uh you go by zero day on Instagram you're like a modern day vigilante uh just some stuff about your hacking life zero day code for discovered security vulnerable vulnerability with zero days to fix the flaw that's the meaning of it 19 plus years hacking 

you're self-taught no college no formal education you claim to have imposter syndrome uh you mentor and teach others on how to learn this trade you've made money from working with Amazon PayPal and Facebook and you say that hacking is the best decision you've ever made in your life sometimes you hack up to 10 hours a day yeah yeah or more but uh you know working with some of those big companies there would be through bug Bounty 

programs I don't know if you're familiar with them I'm not uh that was prior to to uh us starting pentester.com which is a cyber security platform for small medium-sized businesses at the moment to make sure that they're safe online to check for data leaks to to check you know wear your face where your identity is being broadcasted all over the Internet which goes you know hand in hand with what we're we're doing with Predators um and the 

I'm sorry um got mixed up there it's all good while you're thinking every guest that comes on the show gets a gift oh wow there you go go ahead open it up got vigilance or no vigilance Elite gummy bears that's right made in the USA legal in all 50 states Gummy Bear right now 

and wow how did you find out about this we researched you well I know you love Rich cheese crackers you eat what is chicken tenders every day at noon at Burger King and uh Campbell Soup every night I quit the I quit the um I quit the the uh Burger King um and now I'm on the Chick-fil-A at 12 30. I do eat Ritz Ritz Bits cheese crackers 

um every single day Campbell's chicken noodle soup actually I walked two miles last night to Walmart I could have ubered but I walked two miles last night to Walmart to get uh to get one single can of Campbell's chicken noodle soup and uh didn't realize there was a microwave in the hotel room so I even contemplated putting the metal can on the iron to heat it up so that something I could eat it last night you want two miles for a can of Campbell Soup yeah for a 99 cent can of Campbell's Soup yep incredible well if you come here again 

I'll have that weight in your hotel room for you yeah it's all right but uh so moving on in the interview you have a interesting childhood it sounds like overcoming addiction uh I want to get into your childhood how you got into hacking um some of the stuff we can do to protect ourselves from hackers what hackers are capable of and and then the second half of the interview I want to get into all the stuff you're doing 

catching these Predators okay that's very interesting this is going to be one of the most informative interviews I've ever done but um keeping it light right off the bat how did you get how did you get involved with Facebook and Amazon and who is Paypal okay so that was actually what I was thinking about prior to you giving me the awesome gifts um what a bug Bounty program is so I don't personally own a bug Bounty program but I work with you know a team I have a team of hackers that we we all 

work together on projects uh we and to do that legally there's things called Bug bounties so companies like Amazon Facebook YouTube Netflix all the huge companies out there they offer they offer a monetary uh value for a bug or a vulnerability that's found in their site so what I mean by help protect these large organizations it is through their bug Bounty program they may not be a 

direct client of the company or some of them maybe you know but uh can't really talk about that publicly but yes uh I've helped protect all of the all of the above so basically this is like some type of a red adult program where you try to penetrate these these big tech companies and then they they basically give you they give you a reward if you reveal how you did it right so you you have to reward how I'm sorry you have to reveal how you did it so they'll let's 

say it's a informational bug an informational bug could be you forgot that a page exists and it shows some some uh some of your employees information so that may be informational if it doesn't impact anything further than that whereas something very critical like I could get access to your server or all the credit cards or all your clients attached to your company that would be a critical vulnerability um and these companies are willing to pay depending on the severity of that vulnerability so Apple for example if 

you were able to take over an iPhone they'll pay you a million dollars for something like that they'll pay you a million dollars yeah a million dollars for it with they call it a zero click exploit meaning I can send you something that you won't even know happened and I have full access to your phone million bug bounty have you done that before no no I haven't uh I haven't personally found any any uh bugs in the new iPhones um but uh if if I did I'd be sure to report it to Apple so what if you don't 

mind me asking what's the biggest Bounty you've collected and what was it for um I can't tell you what it was for uh but I could tell you how because there's a disclosures and there's non-disclosures so I can't I can't disclose the the company or what what the vulnerability was but it was for over uh it was 128 000 in credit on a platform I chose that over the cash really so these are these are good sized bounties yeah how many how many bounties have you collected 

um I don't know I quite quite a bit 100 200 uh if you combine my team hundreds hundreds yeah but that isn't what I focus on anymore uh it's I focus on the cyber security business which is all software and uh and that's you know a lot a lot more guaranteed whereas bug Bounty not there's nothing nothing against people that do bug bounties but it's not guaranteed uh revenue or income that's you you have to just keep taking 

shots at companies trying to find something and hope that you get paid where there's there's no stability in that oh yeah there's there's bug bounty hunters that make a million dollars two million dollars a year but then the next year maybe they make 10 grand or less so they make or they spend you know six months on one project and they make zero dollars um it's just not it's the same it's not sustainable for me so I started a company with my business partners Rick Sean and Dan and uh like I said it's 

called pentester.com it's very simple you just go to the site you put in the name of your website you press scan and it does a preliminary scan tells you what you know basically if you're if you if you have any like low hanging fruit vulnerabilities uh and leaks you know like passwords associated with your emails or your employees and um you can sign up for an account and do a more invasive scan that will give you a lot more information interesting interesting well let's let's dive into 

your childhood sure where'd you grow up I grew up outside of right outside of West Philadelphia in Delaware County Pennsylvania and uh I yeah I lived there most of my life what were you into as a kid um for the most for the most part I was a normal kid but after eighth grade or so or starting eighth grade I started to meet the wrong people and I was in the wrong places doing the wrong things and 

I met some people that were on drugs that were a little older than me and I started to uh started to adapt and I started to go to these at that time there was a rave scene in Philadelphia and I really liked that I loved going to the Raves and uh doing doing drugs you know and and acting acting like a nut you know and I I was just a young kid that nobody knew that out and I never told anybody my age back then I to be honest with you I I was lying to people 

about my age back then and uh those Raves turned into getting you know doing ecstasy and other types of drugs at the Raves and I found out over time that uh I didn't really like the Raves as much as I like the drugs and then I figured out that when I took when I took something to come down from the Ecstasy that I actually liked when I was coming down from the Ecstasy with more than I like the ecstasy really yeah 

which was uh opiates and uh that turned into a bigger problem yeah that can turn into a massive problem did you did you think you were a full-on addict um at the time yeah I was I was in full belief that I was a drug addict you know I was physically withdrawing from opiates at one point in my life so yeah I had every reason to believe that I was um and I don't know how far you want to go into it at this point but there was 

there was a time where I realized that I went through a bad phase as a child but I do know that addiction exists I have a lot of it in my family um especially my dad's side and um and I did some things to combat that uh you know because of those reasons but uh me personally I haven't used drugs or alcohol in a very long time since I was a child pretty much and um no drugs just uh but I wouldn't say that I'm in recovery either I just I kind of moved away from that 

what was the family life like good family life you close with your parents so I I was I'm very close with my mom my grandfather passed away a few years ago and he was like a father to me he he uh he raised me you know the best father I could have asked for um I wouldn't know what a father's like without him and he passed a few years ago and it was very rough but I was blessed to be there I was with him uh when he passed and he had a great life and it 

was a great man my mom my mom is absolutely fantastic has been supportive with me even at my absolute worst and um I put her through hell um and uh as for my dad he's been he's been in and out of my life uh during this interview while we speak right now he is currently uh in jail for uh for something something stupid this time it was you know drinking I think he 

had an open container of alcohol and he stole some stuff from Kohl's but uh you know my dad and I you know I have some step brothers and sisters that I love and and he when he's when he's messed up on drugs and alcohol he's not the best dad so we you know we go on and off talking to each other so from what I understand you're a high school dropout I am yeah what grade did you drop out going into 10th grade going into 10th grade so you have up to a 

ninth grade education yeah technically yeah and you are the number one ethical hacker in the world how did you get into hacking um it kind of It kind of just happened because I was very young and it didn't just happen I mean there was a lot of stuff that happened in between it but when I was very young my grandparents had a computer at the house and I don't know if you remember this but back in the day AOL I used to send floppy disks in the mail and they give you a trial and um I remember the shape of the floppy disk 

and I remember seeing the front of this desktop that my grandpa I think he brought it home from work or something back then and I remember seeing the shape of the floggy disc and there was a little icon of it on the desktop computer and I was like I wonder what would happen if I put this uh this floppy disk in the computer and I saw the AOL logo from the mail show up on the computer screen and it blew my mind as a kid it blew my mind I was like how did that just happen you 

know how old are you I'm 29. no I mean how old are you at this time I had to have been like eight nine years old at that time maybe um and uh and that blew my mind and I want to know how it worked you know from that point on I just had this obsession with how how do computers work why did that just come from a piece of cardboard and show up on the screen and uh you know I just kept learning and learning about computers and learning you know fixing computers and meeting people you know 

that on the internet through AOL instant messenger and other other apps and then I found um it actually started with a marketing marketing community at first um people that were doing digital marketing back in the AOL days so just spamming out massive amount of emails like millions and millions of emails but then in that Community there were some hackers you know people that were writing automation tools and finding exploits and finding ways to convert on ads better and this and that and I ran 

across this one guy who ended up going to prison later for for hacking uh I believe it was at T and A few other major cellular carriers he was he he stole some prepaid minutes and back then prepaid minutes were a big deal so he stole millions of dollars worth of prepaid minutes with his partner in crime Edwin was Edwin was his partner and the guy that I'm talking about is Robert Moore and his hacker name he went by more ER more R and uh 

he ended up uh he ended up stealing these credits and Edwin would go to these places all over the the malls and the small cell phone stores and it would resell these credits for a cheaper price than the carriers would sell them for so they sold like I said a ton of those and uh Edwin decided to leave the country he left the country he's doing all this fancy stuff private jets Yachts hotels girls cars doing it all well Rob was sitting at home you know hacking for 

this guy this guy wasn't doing anything but selling the minutes um and then rob you know gets a knock on the door to the FBI and they they come in they seize everything he has Rob ends up out of all of this out of millions of dollars worth of sold minutes Rob ends up with like 20 grand in profit and two years in federal prison and uh They confiscated all of his stuff everything that he had and he gets out of prison they uh and Edwin's On The Run they 

finally get Edwin I believe Edwin got like 10 years or something which he deserves it honestly because he took advantage of Rob in a week weak point in Rob's life he took advantage and Rob is not meant for federal prison he and you know he ended up there but yeah Rob is the person that uh from the like I was saying with the instant messenger chats Rob's the person that motivated me to learn about hacking and spent the time with me and showed me some things that because there weren't there weren't learning sites like try hack new or or 

uh you know github.com or any or stack Overflow or Google there wasn't none of that existed back then so you couldn't look up uh you know certain methodologies or hacking or how to do reconnaissance there was another world there it didn't exist um so Rob gave me gave me some pointers uh it's not a cookie cutter thing hacking is very broad so let's let's backtrack real quick how will so you're I believe you said 

you started hacking at 10 years old 11 yeah about 11. at what point are you conversing with with more probably when I was 11 he might not have known August 11 but how did you guys like how did you find them uh group chats you know back in the aim days how does that I mean how does that conversation go hey I'm looking for some hackers to teach me a couple things no no I just I was doing I was marketing and uh and interested in obviously 

active in the communities and I knew what Rob was capable of he could do some really cool stuff with a computer and it was really just asking questions you know and Rob and I got along so well and uh you know I actually flew out to see him later in life to Washington State I stayed with him for a week but uh you know some we kicked it off for some reason I don't know what that reason was I can't remember that far back but uh Rob was Rob was the person that helped me at least get started and what I what I do today what were you one to hacking 

at 11 I think it was more interested in just shutting people's internet connections off like simple stuff you know nothing nothing crazy and making money marketing you know it's you know a lot of 11 year olds would probably not think about selling things on the internet but I wasn't making a ton of money as a kid I didn't have Rich parents or anything like that and I wanted to make money ASAP and I knew that digital marketing at like the groups that I was in I was seeing all these people making fortunes selling you know one example we uh we we were 

selling acai weight loss berries and it was a huge thing back in the day um and there was some affiliate marketers making 30 grand a day doing AOL spams making millions millions of uh millions of emails per day making 30 grand a day on average it would blow my mind and I I don't remember every specific about names and what programs they were on uh like affiliate programs they were on back then but I knew I wanted to be involved in that and I thought that automating it and 

finding exploits and you know in I guess websites or people's people's computers uh would enhance my my profits and uh it did it [Music] but then all the money that I made there uh all the money it made you know it all went to drugs and and doing dumb stuff but you know I wouldn't take it back because I learned a lot I grew up quick 

and uh and there's some benefits there and some things that aren't so good there but well let's let's keep let's stick with childhood hacking so at what point in your childhood did you start making money doing this no I probably probably 12 years 11 12 years old I was already I was right into it I mean how much money are we talking a couple Grand here and there which is a lot for a kid that's a lot for a 12 year old it felt like a billion dollars to me and um so were you always an ethical 

hacker no what are some of the things that you've done that you've hacked into what what's one of the give us some examples so uh I guess depends on what you want to know like people or organizations or both let's go into all of it oh my gosh yeah I mean there's I'm limited I'm limited by what I could say here I know there's a statute of limitations I'm sure I'd be fine but there's some things that I would I regret that I would take back um 

but uh there is one thing out there that's public there's a rap song that mentions me uh about you know are you familiar with crypto mining yes okay so uh I packed a ton of computers uh I had a method I won't explain the method because it still could work today um where I could infect computers with malware and a lot of people that infect computers with malware which is just people you know if you don't know what malware is it comes in various forms but the type that I'm talking about it's 

called a remote access Trojan and that's like the equivalent of me standing in front of your computer uh with full access to it and I can you know I can look through your webcam I could control your keyboard your mouse look at your screen do anything I want without you knowing that I'm there and um I infected a ton of computers and instead of having the remote access Trojan functionality where I could do you know I could take control of these computers I decided to do crypto mining um so at that time it was just Bitcoin 

and uh Litecoin and um you know I had quite quite a bit of uh infected computers mining at all times the thing that I did that was if you could say nice uh was that when the computer was idle it would use a hundred percent of the the processor and the graphics card to mine the coins um and when the computer was in use it would only use 20 so they wouldn't you know have a horrible experience with their computer just being bogged down the entire time but uh that was a I 

guess started around now you had hacked into how many computers 100 thousands thousands of thousands yeah probably tens of thousands and so all of these these tens of thousands computers are mining cryptocurrency and going into your account they were going into a pool so uh pooled mining is a lot of people mining together and then all of the uh 

whoever's putting in the most like I guess the reward is split based upon the um the contribution so if you're contributing twice as much as me you'll get twice as much of a profit um so it was all being sent to a specific pool offshores why did that stop um I I have morals you know and uh there was there was there was a situation that came up where obviously 

the Bots you know if let's say I had to change a pool or something went wrong they had to be updated across the board you know every single bot would have to be updated to be pointed at a different address um I still had access to be able to do that and I was in in a community at that time with some bad people who wanted to you know kind of buy access to my Bots and I wasn't okay with that and um it kind of lined up perfectly with another business 

opportunity that I had in life where I kind of just said you know what screw this I'm done not taking the risk you know if I get in trouble with what they call a botnet if I get in trouble with this bot that I'm doing a long time in prison and it's just it's not worth it to me I I can't get in trouble and uh I stopped I stopped on my own will I didn't get caught um there was people that knew about it you know hackers they may not have known it was me now now they know it's me but at the time they didn't know that it was me but no I didn't get caught and I'm 

past the statute of limitations I didn't hurt anybody maybe maybe your power bill went up a couple cents but that's about it um but uh yeah that's that was the extent of that specific uh hack was that was that the one that was that the the hack that changed you that turned you into ethical or or was there oh I would say yeah I would say yeah yeah because um around that time I switched to doing cyber security and and uh starting the 

other businesses that that you know we're going to talk about it's so yeah I would say yeah yeah I never really thought of it till now but that's when that's yeah I would say that's when I became an ethical hacker rather than a gray hat or a black hat hacker well what is a gray hat hacker gray hat is in between so somebody that like uh for example if I went to your website I hacked your website and I sent you an email and said hey I found a vulnerability on your site you could call you know the FBI and say hey this guy just hacked my site and I didn't give him permission or you could say thank you that was a gray hat hacker and 

a black hat black hat just you know takes over your website tells you hey you better pay me or I'm releasing all your information or deleting your site and uh here's all the information about you and your wife and your family and everything blah blah blah the black hat hackers are you know they they're kind of ruthless so you're in the cryptocurrency business being a hacker or you were would is this the way of the future are we going to what do you think what's your opinion on 

this yeah yeah I mean cyber security and keeping yourself protected on the Internet is the future if you're not paying attention to that now uh you I mean and you're not seeing your browser that's warning you the TV that's warning you the constant news the constant ransomware notices I mean if you haven't heard about the active breaches right now on all of these major websites and you're not doing anything about it you really should start because it is the future and it's only going to get more uh intense and it's only going to get 

more dangerous and everything that you have like you know is attached to the internet everything I mean unless you live out in the middle of nowhere with no internet connection any even even the power in your house is controlled by a remote switch you know like what if I turned off your power for a week and you live out in the middle of nowhere you just you really have to take your security seriously that's just a random thought but it's a possibility I meant I actually I'm glad you brought that up but I actually meant cryptocurrency what's your opinion on 

cryptocurrency is it here to stay it's very volatile very volatile uh I think the bitcoin's here to stay yeah yeah are you all in on bitcoin um can't confirm or deny would you like to see Bitcoin I would love to see Bitcoin hit the Moon I mean it's still well at this moment it's around 30 grand but uh I would love to see what it was projected to be at in the hundred thousands possibly a million 

a coin you think that's possible absolutely I mean it was when I started it was only you know maybe a couple dollars at the most per coin damn well what brought you to South Florida I I got so I started a marketing company for uh to help people get into drug and alcohol rehab and uh for anyone that's familiar with that topic they're gonna think okay we had a marketing company he was doing a thing called patient brokering which is a felony I was not 

doing that I didn't even know what that was at the time I just knew I could generate leads from the internet and I started this company called the treatment source which was just a website that they filled out a survey and the survey would bring them to a 1-800 number if they had mental health or substance abuse they changed the term substance use issues um and I would send then send those patients or clients to a drug and alcohol rehab in South Florida and I was generating a ton of clients 

and doing really well with the internet marketing campaigns and one day I got a call from a guy who says to you know he was like Hey you won't come to Fort Lauderdale airport right now and this is like you know right when I'm waking up and I was like yeah I will like I was just you know he thought I was joking I called him a couple hours later I booked my flight and I was like hey I'm at the Fort Lauderdale airport he didn't believe me and he picks me up at the airport and um you know he was blown away that I even 

showed up there but you know I had just like a week's worth of stuff packed with me and when I got back to his house we were talking about you know like the rehab business and you know the marketing and all the the intricacies of the industry and we became good friends at that point and um I I uh you know I was thinking well why don't I start a rehab you know like maybe maybe I could do this myself if I can generate the business for a rehab maybe we can we could do it together so 

he was like yo I own one now obviously because he was one of my my customers at that time and he decided to sell his shares in his rehab and use that to buy or I'm sorry to invest into one with me and uh we started a treatment center together and I decided to move to Florida so I went back to PA I put my car on the back of a U-Haul filled it up with all my stuff drove down to Florida from Pennsylvania and never looked back and started a drug and alcohol and mental 

health facility how old were you at this point 22 you started a rehab at age 22. yeah I think I was the youngest owners in the treatment world at that time yeah wow what so what was your motivation for this URL from one from our research you are all about helping humans yeah yeah so my motivation was um you know I like I said earlier that you know in my family you know my dad's side 

specifically had some serious drug issues still still dealing with them I went through some serious drug issues uh I you know a lot of friends of mine have gone through drug issues are still going through drug issues um and I just you know maybe I got this from my mom my grandma my grandpa but I just love to help people I don't know what it is it makes me happy and uh I guess would that be Hospitality Hospitality has always just been something that makes me happy well you 

had some pretty tragic experiences as well if I remember correctly do you want to go into any of those uh well there's a lot of them so are you talking more of the addiction side of things or yeah you had a couple friends die so I've had a lot of friends die due to uh to heroin overdose or car fat no fat no butro fat no acetyl Fentanyl and all of the different fentanyls that are getting over here and being you know put in this in heroin and I understand that they 

chose to use drugs regardless of what was in it but they definitely weren't planning on dying um I'll tell you uh I mean I lost tonight my uncle Richie to an overdose I lost my best friend Ricky Rivas to an overdose and uh I was you know I'll tell you that story because this is this is how something else happened but I got a call from uh from Ricky's parents uh a couple years back and uh and they were 

like you know I haven't heard from Ricky since this morning and uh do you mind going over there and checking on them and it was about a 15 minute drive for me and he wasn't answering my phone calls and at this time he wasn't on drugs he wasn't messing up or anything he worked for me at the rehab and we spent every day together um so I go to his I go to his uh condo I walk in the door and uh you know I look to my left and I see him in the bathroom and he had his face up against the uh the vanity and you know 

he was wearing his wearing his shorts and I saw that he had a needle and a spoon and just you know it didn't look good so I ran over and I tried to wake him up and he wasn't waking up so I called 9-1-1 and I'm running down through the elevator to go to get I didn't even I didn't think anything was wrong with him so I didn't bring Narcan upstairs or anything like narcan's but saves opiate addicts from overdosing so I ran to my car I grabbed that 9-1-1 is telling me what to do I get back to the room and uh 

you know they told me to take him off the toilet and put them on the floor and his body was still in the position that it was in when I saw him sitting there and his face was Sideways from being on the vanity and I'm still in denial at this point I gave him the Narcan in his leg I was uh you know giving him CPR like they said to do and um I just uh I remember when the the cops showed up and the ambulance showed up they they uh they didn't talk to his parents I did I told his parents that their son was gone 

and uh which I thought was a little bit ridiculous I thought that the detective should be the one handling that especially with how I was you know I wasn't I was crying my eyes out like lost my best friend you know um I lost my best friend to addiction too yeah yep 

so sorry yeah my best friend uh he was a seal I worked with him at the agency uh he experienced a lot of trauma became addicted to opiates uh for injuries and that just became a you know straight addiction they cut the pills he went to heroin and um 

he he I spent a lot of time trying to get him better moved him with me got him back on his feet got his family involved got him into therapy I mean it was I love this you know we'd been through a lot of together and um he he was a phenomenal hockey player and you know I used to live in Boca Raton 

too and and so he would he lived uh right by me and he kept telling me he wanted to start this hockey non-profit for Wounded Warriors and that he was going to get the Panthers to sponsor it now he wasn't he's one of the smartest human beings I've ever met in my life even when he was high but as it got worse and worse he I mean you didn't even just his appearance she didn't want to be around him he just 

looked sick and I was in the back of my head I was like yeah okay you're gonna get the Panthers on board we'll all be damned because the son of a got the Panthers on board and um he I think it was the the first NHL team to sponsor um a wounded War you had to be a disabled veteran to play on the hockey team okay they he had somebody helping him the Panthers called the guy that was helping them to tell him hey 

we're gonna do it we're going to sponsor the team you got the NHL sponsor we're going to sponsor the team that guy went over to tell him hey dude you did it yeah and uh nobody answered the door and uh trying to keep my together here but um I understand yeah you didn't answer the door um got on a stool to see you know the top 

part and and there he was laying on the floor you know and um sorry to hear that man yeah I know I didn't know what it feels like I just want to want you to know I can relate and I've lost a lot of a lot of friends to addiction likewise that was the first one obviously that happened to me and uh and I you know I found them and uh it's I can't explain that and you know I can't bring them back but all you can do is educate people and try to help more 

people so that doesn't happen to them and you can't fix everybody you know you can't get it through everybody's head that they need to stop and it's dangerous and it's not just heroin and opiates like it used to be it's a you know it's Coke it's meth it's uh it's painkillers that are pressed it's Xanax it's they all are being cut with fentanyl this isn't a conspiracy theory in fact I mean the number one leading cause of death 18 to 49 right now is fentanyl um that's more than car accidents more 

than anything else 18 to 49 years old fentanyl so any drug that you're doing you have to be careful that you know and not be careful you have to you have to just try to get away from it or get a testing kit if you if you refuse to stop doing drugs get testing kits because fentanyl will kill you yeah and uh yeah yeah it's it's pretty rough but with the rehab uh program around that time not not long before I lost Ricky I lost another friend Drew and uh and my 

business partner at that time you know him and I we both you know were friends with Drew and I was always closer with uh with Ricky and um we decided to start a scholarship program and it was called we named it the Drew Drew badgery scholarship program which was to help people get into drug rehab that didn't have the financial means to to pay and the reason you know that's important is because when I was a kid I didn't have Private health insurance or money so there was no way I was going to a nice facility like one I had or other ones in 

Florida or other states that are private the the um the government facilities you know they take Medicare Medicaid but some of them have two three months waiting lists addicts can't wait two three months you know they die and you know as you know it could take it could take one bad those they're dead so having a private facility and somebody that really wants to get clean uh it's if they don't have the right insurance or the right money you have to turn them down and it just 

bothered me so much that you can't help somebody that I was in their shoes you know I wanted help or or people in my family wanted help them couldn't get it and I started that scholarship program with my old business partner and we brought a ton of people in probably over a hundred and the seven years seven or so years that I was there um and maybe even more than that but at least at least a hundred and um you know full scholarship no not they didn't spend a dollar and a lot of them did 

well some of them relapsed you know you can't fix everybody but uh you know it we turned that after after you know time went on WE adapted to hell you know the scholarship program we built programs around that we built programs around trauma we built programs around you know specifically mental health specifically uh co-occurring mental health and substance use disorder all kinds of different things and then we branched out until we opened a detox which was another facility uh because at 

that point we had partial hospitalization intensive outpatient and outpatient but we didn't have detox so we were sending them to other facilities and then we would take them so then we had two facilities and then we realized okay well a lot of our people we were getting are coming from New Jersey or Pennsylvania New York Virginia Massachusetts up in that area so we decided to start another facility in New Jersey and we started uh it was called the shore detox but it got changed again the name of it got changed and um 

I sold my shares in in the rehab about two and a half two and a half three years ago right around the time that uh that I started to you know catch the Predators um and I got into the software as a service world and buying software companies and operating them and selling them so you are an amazing human being man thanks to to do something that has that amount of impact at that 

young age I mean that's just just to do it in general is amazing you know and you did it at what what'd you say 22. yeah that's incredible you realize that I I appreciate it you're welcome I'm still on it I'm still on the mission It's Not Over You know good for you it's uh there's so much more to come and and one spot that I forgot there was the electronic medical record system that we use like the same thing you would see at your doctor when they put in notes about you being you know at the your visit um we used one called uh I will say the 

name but we used one and uh and I got involved with those guys afterwards and uh like after I sold my shares I went right to their office and I set up one of those plastic tables put my computer in there even though I wasn't involved at that time in that business um I wanted to work out of their office because I liked the software world and uh at that point I wasn't sure if I was going to do digital marketing or I was going to do cyber security or both but being around them every day I was like yeah I gotta do it with them so I got 

involved with their business is and then we decided together we're going to do a ton of a ton of software companies and uh that's where we're at now like I said with pen tester.com and and many more but that's the one that makes the most sense to talk about here today well let's uh let's take a quick break and when we come back we'll dive into that okay cool I want to tell you all about this new meat delivery service I found called moink what I really really like about moink is they are from a small 

rural Farm Town in Missouri LaBelle Missouri right by where I grew up and I love supporting small town business USA now when I started looking into moink they educated me on the meat industry and I want to share with you all a couple of facts according to moink magazine sixty percent of all pork is produced by one company in the U.S and that is 100 owned by the Chinese four companies control 

over 80 percent of the meat industry in the United States more than ten thousand different additives are allowed in the U.S food supply 99 of chicken 95 percent of hogs 78 of cattle in the U.S are raised in confinement buildings or feedlots means they're not moving around freely eighty percent of the antibiotics consumed in the U.S are fed to animals here's a stat in 2016 

18.4 million pounds of antibiotics were sold for livestock and that's what you're eating suicide rates amongst farmers are the highest than any other profession and that includes veterans believe it or not I found that alarming now here's what moink is doing to combat some of this stuff which I really appreciate their livestock is 100 born and raised and harvested humanely in the United States 

of America their Farms practice were genitive agricultural methods they are free of GMOs antibiotics and all hormones their Alaska salmon is wild caught their beef and lamb are grass-fed and grass-finished their boxes ship from rural America right in Small Town Missouri love it they're chicken and pork are pasture raised so

Ketone IQ all right Ryan we're back from the break we're getting ready to dive into your company pen tester so what is pen tester pen tester is a software solution for cyber security and protection so we it you know there's a pen test a manual pen test where somebody would go on into your company or a group of people where they would check down a list of boxes of 

things for your compliance look for vulnerabilities based upon your platform and give you a report of findings uh you know vulnerabilities pentester.com it can get confusing because pen testing and Pen tester.com are like pen testing is a term pen tester.com is the name of my company okay um and uh you know what we do is we try to automate as much of what a pen test uh a pen tester would do uh digitally so 

pennchester.com is an automated web scanning framework as of right now we're building it out to be more of a more than than just a web scanner and um sorry I'm getting mixed up no it's fine so let me let me just ask this then so it's hard to explain so I'm trying to make everybody understand let me yeah I get it because I'm a dummy with this stuff um so let me ask you a question then so if I go to pentester.com and I type in 

Sean ryanshow.com yeah what kind of vulnerabilities might I have here's my website I basically I saw gummy bears on it and uh we post upcoming episodes your episodes gonna be on there uh we collect email addresses um for a database to to uh we send out a free newsletter all the time right and then we got like some if you want to if you wanna apply for a job here every 

once in a while we'll post that they can run their resumes we just did a thing where we're looking for a new video editor for shorts and they're sending in a bunch of um we're having a competition for it but for so for a website like and we have advertising inquiries for a website like that it's run off Shopify Shopify what kind of vulnerabilities would I be looking at so you're the there's many things the first thing that came to mind was uh was email breaches so if you have 

like contact Sean ryan.com is that your website Sean ryan.com Sean Ryan show.com Sean Ryan show.com so uh contact Sean Ryan show.com or you know Sean Ryan at the website or anyone that works here I can I can look up that domain with pen tester and see if it's been involved in any breaches or if it's been involved in any uh botnet traffic where it's scraped all of the cookies and passwords from people's browsers okay hold on what is 

bot botnet what tracking traffic botnet traffic right so let's say you were infected with some type of malware there and that person grabbed from your your Chrome or your Safari all of the saved passwords and all of the the sessions like a website to be signed into a website you have to have a session so if I took that session and replaced mine with yours now on mute without a password so some of that stuff gets released on 

the dark web or or you know uh it's a tour I like to call it tour tlr the onion router that's what the dark web is um but it gets released there and sometimes on the publicly facing web and uh a lot of people aren't aware of what information is actually out there so when you put your website into pen tester you get a preliminary report that shows all of that data that has been exposed related to your domain name well it goes a little further than that 

because let's say it doesn't find anything maybe you're a brand new website and you know shopify's is doing a good job with all of the plugins you're using because remember each one of those plugins is by an individual creator that could have messed up at any point in their code so you're only as strong as your your strongest plugin um so that's one thing there Shopify has their own security and then you have your own Security based on your plugins uh as for the emails let's say I get nothing with the Sean ryanshow.com now I'm going to start looking into the 

Gmail accounts of into Gmail Hotmail AOL Yahoo whatever of all of your employees your family and then I'm going to see breaches associated with them which I guarantee you that there is like I I'm so sure that if I pulled my laptop out and I put in one of your personal emails that I'll have at least one of your passwords and that password could be reused for Shopify or maybe it's used to access that list of data with your customers that you were saying you have a The Client List the newsletters the 

the applicants for you know the jobs uh it maybe it's the same password you use for that and now I have access to that data that I could either Ransom you with I could escalate my permissions on Shopify with and take over your entire site maybe it's the credentials to your social media platform uh like YouTube Instagram Tick Tock whatever you whatever you're on you know those credentials could be reused so it is important like as you said using a password manager because all takes is 

someone like me with a bad you know bad moral compass to take advantage of everything that you that you have could you could you demonstrate that right now yeah just type it in my email yeah for sure I'll try the Sean Ryan Show first dot com right yeah 

okay so we have there is some some sensitive information but nothing uh nothing that would be a big deal I can show you I could show it to you actually if you want it's not going to hurt anything yeah let's see it so it's not this isn't specifically passwords there um but uh it is what came from you know leaks on the internet this isn't you know it isn't anything other than uh 

leaked data so nothing there is sensitive to my to my eyes so we're doing a good job for the Sean Ryan show but if you throw in one of your gmails there or something any other email that you may be using for a long period of time just type it in here yep 

you take a second to load it's it loads over 140 billion records nothing nothing on that website there's two e's supposed to be there yeah I would assume so no there's I don't all right my it guy's gonna uh live to see another paycheck well it's not it's not your I.T guy though even uh that one just doesn't 

seem to be registered with a bunch of accounts like for example if you were in 2019 LinkedIn breach for or like or a Dropbox if you use any of that like vigilante vigilance Elite um I do have his password and I do have the address whose address and uh I have a apartment and interesting I have uh an IP address for 

I have an address in where we're at right now with the ZIP code ending in six four and a phone number and then all that shit's on there yeah and I have a lot more than that if you want to look take a look yourself oh yeah let me take a look yeah this I'm halfway through if you could scroll up and down how do we clean this up you can't you just gotta change you got to change the information if you don't want 

it there there is no way to get rid of it okay so what oh my gosh so that's why small and medium-sized businesses that don't realize that they're a Target they're more of a Target than they think uh they get attacked um because they either have exposed credentials out there or they're using old technology and they just get grouped in with a ton of other people that are you know similar targets uh a lot of them don't realize they need to take 

their cyber security more seriously and Pen tester like you know this is kind of like a Shameless plug but like for 50 bucks a month it's it's worth the money you know we're the cheapest to my knowledge in the cyber security world and we're not only giving you a software solution but we're giving you a Hands-On you know manual confirmation for anything that we're not sure of So for 50 bucks like someone would have offered that to me uh prior to being a hacker myself I was a little kid but let's just say I wasn't 

ever you know I would I'd be more than happy to pay 50 a month or something like this this is just one of the one of many things we offer okay so is my website's safe for customers that's up to you to decide I mean I haven't run a scan this is just a breach oh that's just a breach chat yeah yeah and this is we have more records than literally anyone else on the internet so we we're going to be able to tell you more than than uh than most you know most people some people are going 

to have access to these private databases that we have as well as the public ones um but if you download certain other competition websites that say or I'm sorry sign up for other competition websites that say that they offer breach protection or the leak leak uh protection breach or leak protection is what they'll say um they don't have a database as big as ours I'm sure of it I mean I'm very confident in that and this is without running like I said this is without running a scan so you 

know like I'll keep it I'll keep the computer ready for when you want to see a face but I'll show you how Wild that can get let's do that oh you want to see it yeah let's do it so describe what you're gonna do so I'm gonna do you want I could do my face your face anyone's face that you want to do does it you just tell me who's that you can do my face okay it's going to be a lot of pictures of you obviously because of your podcast but so basically what you're doing is you're taking a photo of me it's gonna do the 

facial recognition and find every image on the internet that has my face in it yeah whether I'm tagged in it or not yeah like it's strict you could find my face in the middle of uh the Super Bowl Stadium as long as it's on the internet so yeah let me take a picture and send it to myself um okay 

so I took a picture of your face and you can see it's just a picture that this has never been on the internet right that is a really good looking man right there amazing so I uploaded that to uh to here so you took a picture yep no no you can go through these and see if there's anything that's not not I don't know if there's going to be anything that you don't want on there or not but if you click them it will give you a link to where uh where that 

picture's hosted at but remember I used a picture that was never on the internet to find those photos of you so it measured your face measured 120 points on your face Associated a picture that's never touched the internet with you and uh for somebody that doesn't have as big of a following or as many photos out there there may be less results but you could be in a photo that you're not aware of or uh or there could be some stuff out there that you would want to 

be aware of oh wow this is really this is like everything yeah it just keeps going cool stuff that's insane like most people you'd be crazy not to pay 50 for that as a business it's just that getting that messaging in somebody's in somebody's hands uh and I'm sorry in somebody's brain when they look at the website or 

they they see an ad for hey are you taking your cyber security seriously um and then they run their website through a light Scan they see here's some breach credentials here's some pictures that we found on your site here's some vulnerabilities and you have an option to sign up for free which you get your preliminary report for free and then you have your option for fifty dollars for a small business and you just say you know what screw it I don't need that I just I can't comprehend why you wouldn't want that so yeah damn let's talk about the dark 

web so I hear a lot about the dark web oh yeah the buzzword drugs on it you can find child pornography on it you can you it sounds like it's just the the black market the New Black Market correct yeah so what I've heard about it I know about it I know it's all stuff you shouldn't be doing what how do you get on it where is it okay so the dark web itself isn't a 

Marketplace like what you're thinking all right so the so the black market or whatever you want to call it once you're connected to the dark web tour the onion router what I was explaining before you still need to know where to go to visit these horrible websites and they're like you know imagine a very long string of letters and numbers and the website instead of.com it'd be dot onion you can't visit those websites in a regular browser you have to do that while you're connected to the onion router which you can download at the Tour tor's website 

and then you could go to a thing called like the hidden wiki and the hidden wiki will show you all different categories of these websites with a link to them and uh and there's marketplaces there's horrible things on there like you said for kids and uh and even like murder For Hire there's there's counterfeit money there's fake IDs you know they're all all kinds of different websites that do horrible things what is the onion router so the onion router is a um is a tool an 

open source uh project that was created to anonymize your traffic on the internet and it decentralizes I think I believe decentralized would be the word for it your internet traffic it keeps you Anonymous Beyond a VPN I would still recommend that you use a virtual private Network on top of tour if you want to be anonymous but uh it's just a layer of security that's free and it keeps it it's like for example let's say you use 

uh Comcast for your internet service provider um they could see that you're using using tour but they can't see what you're looking at um if you use a VPN and then you use tour they can they they can only tell you're using a VPN but they can't tell you're using tor so it's you know it's a just an internet within an internet so can I get on can I check my email through the dark web yes would you go to any website would you recommend using the dark web to just do regular it's 

slow as hell internet stuff it's very slow yeah yeah I mean it you could but and it would it would keep you safer but it's it's not gonna it's not a foolproof way to keep yourself safe and it's painstakingly slow oh God do you use the dark web oh for investigations yeah what kind of Investigations um for like the predator predator and pedophile cases yeah so are you able to track these guys down from the dark web 

even though they're technically Anonymous um a lot of times it doesn't need to go that far A lot of times these guys will use their regular emails or they'll use an IP address that's been you know they'll reuse for multiple emails or their face that they're using as their profile picture I can you know find them from the same way I just found your face or they're using a phone number that traces right back to them uh the dark web you know it's it's not really a huge part of uh catching predators and 

pedophiles um uh one one thing I I guess the only thing on the dark web quote unquote I hate that word but the dark web quote unquote that I had access to was when I originally hacked the website that we're going to talk about they branched out to have not only a website on the clarinet on the regular internet but their website was mirrored on the dark web and I had three back doors in their system and uh and it branched out over to the 

dark web so I had a back door on the dark web too which was kind of a cool thing to have so I needed to be connected to tour the onion router to connect to my back door but that was uh I was only using that back door to exfiltrate data every single day which was just user information because I didn't want to get their posts or anything I didn't want to be in possession of anything horrible that they were sending each other but their user info was enough for us as I'm sure you'll learn shortly yeah 

what are some things that people can do to protect themselves from from hackers what let's actually let me rephrase this quote let me back up what are some vulnerabilities just let's go through all the things that you personally could hack if you wanted to um I mean there's it's countless but I could give you some major daily things uh absolutely let's talk about some of the devices those devices you have right 

here let's talk about all the stuff you can hack into sure and then and then we'll get into maybe how we can prevent that a little bit so I guess we'll just start with a daily routine you know if you wake up in the morning you uh you make your coffee or maybe you take your phone off the charger and you um you check your phone in the morning you might you might check your email you might have you got to make sure you every email that you have while you're half asleep is coming from a real person it's not a phishing email someone pretending to be a company that they're 

not stealing your credentials then you go outside to your garage you get in your car and you have to make sure that there's nobody out there listening for your you know your car key frequency while jamming your car so that they could steal your car later or access your car later and then when you go hit your garage door button that somebody doesn't capture that frequency on 4 33 megahertz and uh and you know and those rolling codes have already been broken for most of the models um so then you get in your car and you're driving to uh to to your office 

or to to your kids school doing whatever you want and um you know you could get out you let your kid out to school and now somebody as you walk into school just skimmed your back pocket and stole your credit card information so I mean all of that plus you know any anything remote infrared like a TV remote that goes for projectors uh audio devices ceiling fans I mean very simple stuff uh along with Access Control 

badges so anything sub gigahertz like like key fobs or remote controls for anything um parking Gates so much everything everything I mean everything anything with a battery and a connection a remote connection in any type of way where it reaches the outside of that device is hackable or has been hacked what are these devices here this is a water bottle 

uh so this right here is a this is a flipper zero with some custom modifications and uh it does a lot so this is just a proof of concept device but when you start to add your own little additions onto it like this um let me uh let me enable for example Wi-Fi I'm not gonna hack your Wi-Fi but I'll give you a little example of what I could do I'll just do something stupid but 

okay and then we'll do I'm not gonna shut your network down okay so now if you if I can show you on my phone or you could look at your phone but you'll see that instead of me mirroring your network I just created a bunch of fake Networks 

so all of these networks here they probably appear to be legitimate right yeah but they're not these are all fake networks they're all powered by me so as soon as you connect to any of those I have your password I have anything in between so that's that's one thing that's just Wi-Fi and you just oh man so this is so this is is this how 

people are stealing information this is one of them anyways in in an airport in an airport oh yeah I mean airport Starbucks um when you uh it's called a man in the middle attack so if I'm on the same network as you I can essentially control the traffic uh you know as if I was the modem or router so instead of when you type google.com instead of your computer telling the router you want google.com you're telling my computer you want 

google.com and I'm giving you what I what I'm telling you google.com is so it would be called a DNS DNS attack so is this what people are using in the airports when there's I'm not the specific device this is just something that I concocted together but the flipper you can buy this thing on the top here is is uh custom I guess what I'm asking is this the method they throw so could you can so let's what is um put like Wi-Fi flight 

or uh Gogo Gogo inflate yes they're actually I mean you can obviously you can hack anything but GoGo inflate they they have a pretty good segment on their Network so you're pretty safe with GoGo uh you there's a chance of getting hacked but not the same as like a Starbucks or a or here like you know your network has to be segmented into chunks okay and uh go go segments it pretty well okay I guess what I'm saying is could you create a fake Wi-Fi network 

with that thing that says go go in Flight one yeah that must be it I can do that here I mean it's I can make any any they're called as bssids ssids the name of a network you could do that with any name but instead of that what you do is you just scan the local area and then you know I know all the networks names around here and then I'll Target all of them at the same time so that that way anyone in this complex or where we're at 

um you know anyone that connects to a network is going to you know think it's their Network and they're going to connect to me instead holy that's just one of many Wi-Fi attacks so there's many ways yeah what else can this thing do oh this thing's like the size of the palm of your hand yeah well with this with this little you know custom extension especially when I have my big these aren't the big antennas but I got big antennas because you know I want to get long range but uh you know that's Wi-Fi this this side of 

things is also Wi-Fi but uh also it's an NRF uh 24 so it does Wireless mice and keyboards so if you use a wireless mouse and keyboard not every single one of them is vulnerable a lot but a lot of them are I'd highly recommend you go back to wired even though it sounds old school that's what you should do because I could control your mouse and keyboard with this device and send keystrokes way faster than you can type them and uh take over your computer without even having to see you or it so I could do 

that through the wall um this is scaring the out of me um and then I you know I the sub gigahertz stuff with bigger antennas of course I can go further away so with the car car keys garages Gates anything that's on radio frequency I could do with this um RFID that's Access Control badges for doors and and pool Keys you know anything that has like a little beeper where you beep into the the door yeah 

and NFC is credit cards and access control and it does also some more things too you could also like I could tap your phone and give you my Instagram or tap your phone and give you my business card so NFC is a little more uh versatile than RFID but they both essentially are uh I believe it's called passive devices they're powered by the uh the receiver they don't have a battery in them so what let's just run through just a list 

of all the things you can hack with that one little device I mean I don't want to make it into an ad about flipper because it's not flipper itself like I'll tell you but I'm just saying that flipper itself if you're going to go online and buy one of these and expect to be able to do everything that I'm talking about you need to have custom firmware or software whatever you want to call it um that allows you to do that and you need to know how to modify it so don't go out spending 180 on this device thinking you're gonna hack somebody's car or steal their credit card because that's not going to happen 

um but if I if you want to go down the list I mean there's a ton of things there's like you know all the radio things I just told you about um the RFID stuff the NFC which is the credit cards and and more infrared which is TVs projectors and many other devices gpio which is just anything that connects to the outside of this device so I can make devices work and this be the controller for it uh I button which is a form of authentication that uses 

um these things these little metal prongs as a key a bad USB which emulates a keyboard types like you know a couple thousand words a second wow or I'm sorry a minute I'm sorry a thousand words and a couple thousand words a minute uh and then it also has some use cases that aren't hacking like uh two-factor authentication this is a you know offline device where you can generate your two Factor without needing a device that's connected to the internet so it does that too and then there's a 

ton of other sub applications that are on here like hundreds of them that do little little things so a lot just with this one device this thing you know it it does just radio but it does a lot more than this thing really yeah what does that one do this one you can hack airplanes with I mean that I mean that's an extreme but that's something that you can actually accomplish with this using adsb um you can choose to either receive or transmit um so you can choose either receive or 

transmit adsb with this device and that's the frequency to tell a plane you know this call sign position and and more and um it's very illegal to do that of course but uh if I wanted to go outside right now I could even demonstrate later for you like you know I pull this antenna out this is just a small antenna um and we could receive airplanes see where they're at there's nothing illegal about receiving them um transmitting is where it gets a 

little bit funky you know uh but yeah adsb this one does a lot I something like a joke for example Touch Tunes they're at a bar their little jukebox machine Duke box machines that you pay for yeah this device uh Brute Forces them meaning goes through zero zero zero to nine nine nine nine looking for a PIN code and once it gets it I can fully control that jukebox like like I have like I'm the owner of it so you know just just for fun or Subaru cars some some years 

of Subaru I have this pre-programmed that can unlock and unlock unlock and lock a Subaru no problem um I could do that with this as well but this thing way stronger bigger range way more support way more programs out there this device is a lot more dangerous in my eyes than that device really yep man you are a I think if this is the fifth time I've said it I think you are a dangerous man but well I'm safe safe you know yeah ethical you could be if 

you wanted to be I'm trying to go into detail about these things just for the just for the Nerds out there like me that are listening I'm not going into exhaustive detail about these devices because most people are not going to care so I'm just giving the general overview oh I think I think they're gonna care when they realize how vulnerable they are no I don't mean they don't care about what what they can do but they care about the technical specifics yeah we get a lot of our we pretty much everything that we have is from China 

okay you know all of our Electronics everything it all what do you say 90 of it probably comes from China do you think we need to worry about what they're putting in our Electronics uh yeah yeah I mean I'll give you one example I bought this awesome vacuum and mop that's in one All-in-One Vacuum out called tinaco and uh it completely connects to a Chinese server to uh to 

transmit and receive information like I made it I made a joke out of I actually have a video of it where you could turn the audio on for it like when you plug it in it says charging started charging stopped like when you put it on and off I can control that with my computer through a Chinese Cloud Server there's no reason that that vacuum and MOB should connect to a Chinese cloud uh Cloud infrastructure whatsoever but uh it does and at any point they could change the way that functionality works and take over my home network with this 

vacuum mop so are you serious with a vacuum mop yep how many devices do you think has have these things in them anything with a Wi-Fi connection that's you know not ever not everything's going to be China beaconing back and forth but anything with the Wi-Fi you know anything with Wi-Fi capability is going to open up you know an attack vector washing machines refrigerators just oh yeah why does a vacuum mop I don't know 

Wi-Fi capability I'd love to tell you that it's uh I have I have the video I could show you I could find it sometime but it's uh I have that and then I have the app I could show you I can adjust the volume I can check when the last time I used it doesn't need to be cleaned does it you know it tells you all that stuff but it's using a Chinese server that I can control from my computer now that I've captured the traffic between the mop and the server how many devices do you think we have that are connected to a Chinese 

server and what would they be getting out of it I mean it's all about data nowadays so I mean I think the data is the most important thing to them because it's worth money and uh advertising dollars or or would be spent better for you know with targeted demographics so I think that they're using that information to Target you on the stuff that they that you need you know if you or someone that you love is looking up something 

obviously Google's going to figure out uh how to Target you on that on that thing and then sell that data to other people and they go they call it retargeting whereas if they have access to your direct Network and they can see you know things that you didn't even fully search out or you're typing on a different application like a chat application where you're not even searching about you're just talking about it that data is very valuable because they know about something before Google does or somebody some other large data broker 

interesting what are what are five simple things that people can do to protect themselves from from hackers who's the password manager um install an antivirus or consult with an I.T company that has cyber security expertise or a cyber security company uh one of one of those many options but talk to somebody unless you're an expert yourself uh use an RFID blocking wallet uh and 

potentially if you want to be extra safe use a key fob that has an RFID shield on it that way your key fob doesn't work outside of that Shield can't be cloned some cars require you know top to start so you know use something like that uh be careful with the websites that you're visiting if the browser is telling you the site looks unsafe then it's probably unsafe and if uh you know if you're told otherwise make sure who who's telling you otherwise is legitimate 

and you know just be careful I mean just use your common sense if something looks too good to be true it probably is okay what about we're we live in a day and age where you're getting spam calls every five minutes you're getting spam text every five minutes and a new marketing emails coming in every two minutes it's I mean it's ridiculous do we need do we need to worry about that stuff if I open a text 

could I be hacked just from opening the text technically yes I mean like I said earlier the zero click attacks that they're willing to pay a ton of money for there's government agencies that already have them you know that there was one going around for uh quite a long time uh there was one going around for quite a long time called Pegasus I don't know there's another one called Pegasus 2.0 and it didn't require any user interaction from you know from anyone you would just send to a phone number they'd have full remote access to your 

phone even without opening the text without opening anything holy how do you defend against something like that yeah you can't there's no there's no way to Defenders that's why they're so valuable because there's nothing you can do how do most hackers get in do you have to click a link yeah yeah I mean sometimes it's a link sometimes it's a file sometimes it's a photo sometimes it's a chain of exploits of multiple things that turn into it it 

could be a Word document it could be anything um when it comes to zero days and zero click exploits it's uh it doesn't require any user interaction and you will not know that your phone's infected damn yeah so I can't even give you a good answer for it this is scary stuff I could I could I might as well have it on my phone right now I have no clue I mean I'd likely see the traffic going in and out of it but uh there is still the chance that it could have it all right let's take a quick break and 

when we come back we'll get into what you're doing now the US dollar how many of you out there still have any confidence whatsoever in the US dollar probably not very many I don't either you see there's a growing concern on the devaluation of the US dollar right now and rightly so here's why inflation we are at an all-time high right now on inflation it will now cost you 12 

dollars to buy one carton of eggs that is absolutely absurd let's talk about interest rates interest rates through the roof if you're in the market to buy a house right now you're going to get roughly 50 percent less house because they've raised the interest rates so high let's talk about the stock market way down especially the tech stocks crypto way down Congress spending more money 

than you or I or anyone else we know can even fathom counting and the FEDS what are they doing they're just printing money like it's nobody's business devaluing our dollar meanwhile China is running around the globe right now striking deals latest one Saudi Arabia and Iran new oil deals trying to turn the yen into the new Reserve currency which in 

turn will devalue our dollar it might be time to start looking at where to protect your money and you might want to look at precious metals I believe gold and silver is one of the safest assets to protect your savings in your retirement against inflation and recession if you're interested in investing in gold I suggest you call my friends at Lear Capital a lot of folks these days are extremely concerned about the 401ks

before making an investment decision thank you you've probably heard me talk about my psychedelic Journey last year and all the benefits that came from doing it one being that I haven't drank in almost a year I have not had any caffeine in almost a year my anxiety has gone my anger is gone a whole list of benefits came from that and it led me down this journey of researching benefits of mushrooms and fungi in general in my 

research I found this company called Mud water mud water is a coffee alternative with four adaptogenic mushrooms and herbs with a fraction of the caffeine as a cup of coffee I have energy without anxiety Jitters or the crash of coffee what I really like about mud water is that they took the time to find the perfect ingredients to make a product to help you feel better every day I genuinely believe that mud water is a good product it's Whole30 approved 100 USD organic non-GMO gluten-free vegan 

and kosher certified mud water also donates monthly to the Berkeley Center for Science of psychedelic Texas mud water believes the country is a mental health epidemic and so do I go to mobwater.com Sean to support the show and use the code Sean mud for 15 off that's mudwater.com Sean use the code Sean Mudd for 15 off foreign we're back from the break we just got a whole class on hacking and 

all the stuff that you're capable of and all the things we need to be worried about but let's talk about why you came here and that's what you're doing now you're basically hunting down these people that are exploiting children sexually on the internet and in person yeah I know you have a couple of horrific stories one guy that was I think it was his daughter in the bathtub yeah yeah so I'll start you know kind of 

where that all uh came from um I was at a friend's a friend's house and I got a text message from my friend's wife and it uh it was multiple photos of screenshots of this website that was uh it was clear from the screenshots that the website was on the regular internet anyone could access it and um should I name the website yeah it was uh it's no longer up but it was dot Co so 

uh dot Co the night website went down that it ended up being t-o like t as in Thomas I was an Oscar so I see this website and I see the content uh in these screenshots that my friend's wife sent me she doesn't know anything about computers but she has kids herself and she was like can you do something about this um I read this content and uh one of them was was uh was talking about a mother that wanted to have have kids and then 

have the kids be so that that when the kids grew up that they could you know have and go even further I mean I'll pull up the screenshots because I'd like to explain like where my head was at that time but as soon as I read these messages I uh I like I guess a switch flipped in my brain and I left my friend's house immediately as I got the text and I was I went home I didn't know for sure that I was going to be able to get into this website I just knew I wanted to do 

something about it and uh I found the vulnerability in their platform I got in uh and from that point on I started to uh to exfiltrate the data every single day all the users um I noticed that that a lot of people were soliciting on the site so I uh I didn't want to download those messages in case of the fact that I pull in some images that I'm not allowed to have and nor do I want so I made sure to only download the 

publicly facing stuff which didn't include it had some very graphic text but it didn't include anything illegal which I think it should be illegal to talk that way but it was it was horrible stuff what what were some of the so you started this basically from a text conversation with a concerned Mom that's what got you into it yeah what's some of the text that you saw I'd like to read them too if you want I 

still have them read them so this is before I was before I ever caught a single predator in my life this was this was the beginning and what set my set my brain off um to uh to want to help but this is before I even heard of this website before I heard of anything and anything to do with it um okay here they are um so the title should I read these like they're graphic yeah breed them so the 

title of this post is who wants these little um and then somebody replied underneath I've got first dibs on them uh Joseph fritzel Maximilian uh which is there's two different users there pick for yourselves um and this was the photo that they used foreign oh my God 

that's just one of three three texts these girls look like they're six very young yeah and then there was that one story where I told you about the I can't see it but the the story I told you about the bathtub situation where there was a father who posted their child in the bathtub and uh they it said underneath of it um they have no idea what's going to happen to them tonight and then underneath that there were 

people that were part of this website who were saying what they were going to do to this child and this wasn't just some fantasy that this guy was talking about this was a you know a guy posting his child in the bathtub like for real like it really was his child um I assume he was a man but it was a parent um you know so that really got to me and then uh I got another part of this text message I'll just read one more of the three and this one says that they are a 

16 year old a lot of these people were role-playing to be children and in our investigations we found out there was a lot of actual kids on this website real kids they were under 18 at the time of uh this this when I hacked the site what are they doing on there they're selling their bodies for money kids two of these people yeah it's kids prostituting themselves yes yes so one of them I don't know if this is a real 16 year old or not but what was said was pretty disturbing regardless uh it said God I 

really want to be a mom I need someone who wants to 16 year old when I have our daughter I'd let you do whatever you wanted from whatever age make me watch as you teaching her how to lovingly don't worry if it's a boy you can watch teaching them how to properly woman teaching them how to slap and hurt me to 

he'd be so cute trying to a little God so when I got these text messages and reading them even current day right now um it it makes me sick to my stomach to even think about and uh and I know they're gone so you know I mean not all these people are still out there but the website's down how many how many people are on this website at first I thought it was a 

couple thousand when I uh cleaned up the database and and figured it out there's about 7 000 people and just this one website and uh we have a total of five you have seven thousand people on one website you've mm-hmm and you couldn't you couldn't become a member of this website unless you answered uh an application where you you you had to answer a question that was something like are you okay with uh you know doing 

something horrible with the three-year-old and in all of their holes you had to answer that question in detail I forget the exact verbiage of the question it's it's a it's posted somewhere um in regards to this interview or or project Veritas one or the other uh but you had to fill that out to become a member of the website you just saw and which would tell me that either you're an undercover cop or you're an actual predator on the site I mean who would answer a question like that even if they were just curious is there multiple so 

it's a whole questionnaire you have to do to get into the site there was a few questions I think two or three they were really horrible but you had to answer them or they were not would not approve you to join the site is there any other prerequisites to get on sites like these um yes so so what I learned in this process during the investigation and exporting you know everything that I could legally export uh I found that they used a chat app called Telegram and 

they were going back and forth talking about uh about you know they would call it cheese pizza and use all the time to all kinds of different phrases for it and I realized there was these moderators in the chat rooms outside of the website um where if you would send them they would let you into another group which was full but of course I couldn't do that so I never got to see past that part but I do have evidence of that being a thing when 

I have because I exported all the chat logs so I can it shows that if I were to send something horrible to one of those moderators I would have seen something even worse which is hard to imagine than you know we are already seeing here what did you what did you do with that information it helped actually let me backtrack I'm sorry how how long did it take you to crack into that website and get this information um I I wasn't sure like I said when I got the text messages and I wanted to 

try to take my goal was to just take the site down and I knew I could make that happen because it was on the clear net uh regular internet for anyone to visit I knew I could do that but I didn't know if I could actually get access to their server once I found the vulnerability uh maybe an hour two hours at the most if I could remember correctly it wasn't long and they never found out they were hacked so to this day um they they never found out and they will never find out 

I mean unless unless somebody in that database is watching this uh now you know you're on you're I have your data and uh we will find you so I actually recommend you come forward so we don't have to make the story up for you what did you do with this information so as soon as I got the information I would I thought it was slam dunk I thought like these people were going to jail you know I thought maybe I solved something that that the FBI or somebody was you 

know working on for a long time and uh I instantly went to the exploited children uh tip line and I uh I submitted you know saying who the owner of the website was that I had access to all the data and uh and that they were welcome to have it basically um then I reached out to a bunch of news articles or I'm sorry news stations and to talk to a ton of reporters and all of them were super excited to talk to me what news stations 

um Sun Sentinel daily mail Business Insider Fox Summit some influencers Ronan Farrow Candice Owens they both didn't read my messages but as for the news stations they you know I had full conversations with the reporters they knew what they were getting themselves into they were very excited about reporting on it and once it got back from legal they weren't allowed to report on it um um I said well okay if you're not allowed to report on the illegally obtained material that I have just let 

parents know that this website exists and who you know what you know whatever you want but just keep whatever illegal out of it you know I just want them to parents to know that this website exists you don't need to put my name you don't need to put the material that I obtained nothing uh every single one of them completely disregarded me I you know I sent a lot of those notes over to project Veritas with some evidence of that but uh not a single person until now has done anything about this not one 

not any conservative media not any liberal media because unfortunately that's the day and age we live in now right um none of them none of them would touch this no none of them want to be involved in Saving kids when I say I tried I tried so hard and nobody wanted to do anything so what wound up happening with the information so 

law enforcement didn't want to get involved either no so I called my attorney uh locally and I called an attorney in Virginia because the owner of the website happened to be a democratic politician and ran for congress two times his name is Nathan Larson and I'll explain more about him in a second but I talked to a lawyer in Virginia because I knew that's where he lived and I wanted to see what I could do from there so the lawyer in Virginia basically told me she didn't know what to say she never heard of 

anything like this um the lawyer in Florida reached out to the local task force let them know that I had access to the information and then as well as you know doing that tip line so from that point on uh you know all of these news stations and all the law enforcement connections whatever you want to call them they all were fully aware that Nathan Larson was running this website that he was you know he ran for congress twice that uh that he was an extremist he did crazy things 

um but he he did run for Congress two different times at Virginia so I thought that they would take that seriously well completely ignored completely ignored it project Veritas gave me access to some of the stuff you guys are working on together and in one of those videos you're reading a quote from Nathan Larson I'm going to read it right now this is from Nathan Larson Democratic politician the RAM for cubic Congress 

multiple times ran a website for pedos to discuss their dark intentions and Fantasies here's the quote it's not enough kids and take their innocence you also need to reproduce the Next Generation with them let them see that you prefer to The Offspring you have with them than to continue to have with a woman who is no longer jailbait the quote continues 

but you can still sometimes just let her know though that what you love her for the most is producing with you is producing with you a fresh new young girl and that this is her main value and contribution hat you think fondly of her this is disgusting I'm sorry you think fondly of her for because that beautiful 

daughter reminds you of her it's unimaginable it's like how how do people think this way but there's so many people that think this way that it's alarming is the word for it I don't know how how else to put it it's way more people than you'd think than you'd like to believe code words pizza and cooking 

and cheese pizza stands for yep Yep this is disgusting yeah I think it's only worse than that you know it's it's really bad how much worse does it get worse I mean people if this this is a person talking about it and it makes me uncomfortable it just as much as much as it makes you uncomfortable but uh you 

know these people what they're talking about they're they're doing you know this guy isn't some guy with a bunch of fantasies this guy got arrested six months after nobody did anything about it and uh you know like I said I try my best he gets arrested six months later with a 12 year old in uh at a layover at an airport after he kidnapped her so not only did he uh talk about it he did it and he he got caught you know as for some other people I don't know how much 

more I can go into it but one guy we're investigating um as of 2020 which is after I submitted the data he got in trouble for doing something horrible to a child as well became a fugitive and I think they eventually got him but you know we're we're not even close to through the list yet and uh you know we got a lot more people to expose and they're not just talking about it they're doing it let's backtrack real quick because you kind of breezed over what happened um so the guy 

with the pit with the daughter in the bathtub yeah what happened that guy with the daughter in the bathtub I don't know where he went he's part of the database I'm talking about the guy that got arrested in Denver oh that's that's uh Nathan Larson okay so Nathan Larson he got arrested six months after the fact um after I hacked his site after I submitted it to the authorities to all the news stations he gets arrested with the 12 year old girl and gets arrested for kidnapping and I don't think he got 

charged with rape but he got the kidnapped in charge um Nathan Larson then went to federal prison for that and um you know the website went down and uh you know he just he sat in prison for I forget forget what the sentence was but it was quite a long time and to my knowledge when you're when you're a person like him you are going to be put except you're going to be separated in a federal prison from the regular inmates and 

you know spoiler alert but Nathan Larson's dead and uh the reason why he's dead is due to starvation the news says that it's suicide um if I had to guess the inmates that were you know responsible for feeding him just let him you know starve to death and I I believe he deserved every second of that pain you and me both so there's been there's been five I'm sorry there's been five other sites that you've cracked into so when when I 

hacked uh rapey it uh Nathan left back up so this previous websites on the same server so it really only took one site to get all five how many names all together um I'm not I can't give you an exact number I'm not sure I bet it's tens of thousands tens of thousands of people and are these people all in we're at work do you know where they're all at um all over the country all uh summer some are international but most 

of them you know are in the country so when did 561 PC start um so 561 PC is an organization that um I created with a friend uh Scrappy he's an MMA fighter um it started because of the frustration that nothing happened from this original uh this this whole ordeal you know I'm this we're talking two and a half years after the fact I've been you know looking into information on Predators for organizations on YouTube 

um anonymously with my name not attached whatsoever just finding information and uh sending it over to the organizations um and then they would go and confront them theirselves and I did that for many organizations like I said completely anonymously I wasn't looking for recognition or my name to be attached to anything um I meet Scrappy that's the Lamppost whatever you want to call them he uh he he's a really good dude and hold on Scrappy is a professional MMA fighter in 

the UFC correct well he did not he didn't he didn't get his call for the UFC yet but uh he's you know 8-0 undefeated seven Knockouts he's he's likely gonna get the call he's on the way yeah yeah and um even Dana White knows who he is I believe um it's uh it's it's you know he's a good dude outside of fighting he's a very nice guy gentle heart you know religious guy you know great great person in my eyes so he was a good partner to pick for this upcoming project and I brought up I was like hey man 

um you know do you know how bad it is on the internet like I told him the story that I just told you he was blown away by the fact that nothing happened and I told him I said like you know let me show you let me show you how bad it is not just tell you so I was like Google search uh teen chat room Florida or you know it was something of that something similar to that so he Googled it I told him click any chat room I don't care which one it is he clicks the chat room he click guess you click guess that you know you didn't have to make an account made his name Ashley 13 female Florida 

something like that and just said hi in the chat room and within five minutes he must have got 40 50 60 messages from grown men some naked some been trying to video chat so I'm saying that you know they want to meet up and a very horrible things that grown men hanging out in these teen chat rooms um from that point on he realized how serious this actually was and I was like hey well you know that it's not just these chat rooms it's most of the time it's social media apps like so like 

Facebook Snapchat Instagram Twitter Tick Tock Tinder um oh you know all of them it's anywhere a kid has access to Roblox Minecraft their Xbox when they're talking to their friends um these predators are on everything so I said to them hey if we get some decoys in there and they you know grown women or grown men they pretend to be children we can go and try to catch these people and expose them in real life just the same way I've been helping organizations for two and a half years do it except 

instead of me sending it to them we'll do it ourselves we'll clean up our you know at least try our best to clean up our our whole our town in South Florida and he was like yeah man I'm definitely down to do it and of course you know at first you think when somebody says they're down to do something like that it's a hit or miss but he was like he was on point ready to go and uh you know we've caught 14 people now in a couple months of of doing it and you know local law enforcement Delray Beach police have 

been incredible and we're just going to continue to grow you know if anybody's interested in checking that out it's at 561 PC like 561 Predator catchers on Instagram same as for YouTube and uh yeah you'll find me there and you'll also find uh Scrappy there let's rewind what what is what was your first operation like my first what your first operation what's the the first guy you guys caught together as a team how did that go down 

so the first guy we caught as a team was just a complete test uh Scrappy and I used an app called Grindr which is a gay dating app for the most part not only gay but mostly gay and um we both use the filter to make ourselves look younger and uh we just started talking to any guy that messaged us we didn't message anybody first we waited for people to message us and uh one guy eventually within an hour decided to talk to us and we went out met him 

called the cops and a guy the guy ran to the bathroom we couldn't film in the bathroom where'd you meet him uh right on Atlantic Ave in Delray in front of a million people and uh you know I embarrassed I screamed at the top of my lungs at what he was there to do and uh you know I don't do that anymore because you can get it disorderly conduct for that I didn't know that at the time but uh that was my first encounter guy just ran into the bathroom no one hid until the cops got there and at that time the cops had no clue what was going on so 

they just let him go have you gotten anybody arrested yeah multiple people how many uh three so far let's go over the first one that you got arrested what did that operation look like um our one is actually uh no actually I think do you mind if I go over the guy that I know uh the full story of right now because some of them are active 

so the one guy we have a YouTube video and uh we we made him you know I did pull up I'm sorry uh we're gonna do push-ups and sit-ups you know to distract them well the cops were on their way and uh he said that you know that the girl had breeding hips and I believe he said something about uh wanting to take a shower with her or something like that um and how Florida works is they have the police station and then they have 

the state attorney some states have District Attorneys some states have state attorneys I think they're the same thing but they're just named differently but the state attorney is the one that ultimately makes a decision on the if the person is going to be convicted or charged with the with these charges but the cops make the decision on what they're being charged with so who meet the guy he admits to everything you know that he said in the chat logs he admits that maybe even a little bit more then he admits it again to the police officers he goes in the interrogation room I send the chat logs 

and the video to them while they're interrogating um he admits everything to them because it's not evidence until the Predator says it like our evidence isn't isn't valuable because we're Vigilantes so you know it's not technically evidence unless the police obtain it so uh all that went well the cops spent Delray police spent a ton of time building the report out for this guy State Attorney you know was kind of iffy about it it seemed and the entirety of 

the case was thrown out because uh there was no shower inside of Walmart so there's no way he could have showered you've got to be me yeah yeah so it's it's a little bit rough we had a meeting who's responsible for that case getting dropped um I don't I know it's the state attorney for whoever Palm Beach County for Palm Beach County but yeah it's I don't know the exact name is that an elected slot I believe so 

uh we should look that name up and post it right here it's wild to me but but the one thing that I can say is that this one of the sergeants who used to be a detective did have a meeting with us right after that and told us what the state attorney would be looking for to secure a conviction so we are trying to fall within those guidelines now like we call the cops regardless every time but we're not sure if we're going to get an arrest or not unless it falls within the guidelines that we're told Ryan do you think you could demonstrate right here 

right now how fast these sexual predators predators will show up in a chat room yeah fire your computer up let's do it all right I'm recording so now I'm just gonna say hi who wants to chat and I named myself Ashley female New Jersey 13 female New Jersey let's see how many private messages come in two already three 

it's been like 10 seconds yep hey you want to fool around Hey how old are you let me just copy that and send that to everybody because we've got other messages coming in what chat room are you in just a teen chat hey you want to cuddle a bit I didn't I I mean I'm taking I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt right now that uh that they didn't read the oh he's 47. 47 years old in a teen 

chat room you got him in what five seconds he's already messaging in oh yeah there's a Tony there's I can't even keep up with them here because every time I click one there's more on the list uh he says I said are you okay with my age he says yes age 13 like my profile says I got two more messages so now we're at one two three four five 

I'm 19. Let's ignore the 19 year old even though it's disgusting it hasn't even been 60 seconds yet there's another guy here's the other guy this guy's 15 ignore him that is a real teenager in a teen chat uh uh the 47 year old says he said age I said 13 like my profile says he said name 

Ashley and then another guy just messaged how old are you okay this person is a child too so out of all of these there's one guy here who is 47 years old less than a minute who wants to talk to a child in a teen chat and I only said hi in the chat room nothing else holy dude you you jumped in a chat room you called yourself Ashley 13 New Jersey 

um literally less than 10 seconds we have a 47 year old one to one to have sex with a with a 13 year old girl yeah yeah that's how quick it is like I Googled team chat uh I'm in a different state so I get different results here for you know the local teen chats there's no way for me to set it up you know all I did was say hi in the chat room and press enter and you know a bunch of messages came in 

some were from actual teenagers as it should be in a teen chat and uh one of the guys which you know who knows if they really are teenagers that's another thing but one guy was open about that he was 47 years old and he was completely fine with the age where where all is this happening is this happening just list off where this is happening that's that that everyday people use all the time uh Facebook Instagram Tick Tock Snapchat Kik what's up uh Roblox Minecraft Xbox 

Playstation Xbox and Playstation yeah because you can chat with random people in games um they could represent themselves as whoever they want um yeah yeah I mean it's just the list goes on anywhere where a human can communicate with another human the child is not safe so parents need to be watching that and not just assuming like you know if you're if your kid says hey I'm on the phone with my friend 

which friend is it you know is it is it one that I know um like you can't be scared of being a helicopter parent because if your kid's aggravated at you for a couple of minutes for you know being overprotective in these scenarios I think it's worth it's not your fault regardless of what happens but to save them from a life of trauma I think it might be worth the extra couple minutes or aggravating your kid to see who they're actually talking to see which who their friends really are and uh just 

spend that extra time because it could it could save a lifelong battle with trauma this happened to somebody I know in in Parkland you know remember I used to live in Boca so I got a lot of friends down there have it in Parkland he's got a daughter couple daughters and she was she she was blackmailed by somebody and had taken pictures and it's it's it's everywhere just as you 

just demonstrated it I mean 10 10 seconds less than 10 seconds and he and he's on there yeah is this is this the case every single time uh yeah yeah some of the guys want to chat for longer before they meet up in person but uh yeah it's it's that easy no it's it's not good that it's easy but it is that easy to to find them they're out there and they are they're they're being predatory like you know like the name States how 

I don't I didn't I don't know what to call it I don't want to call it a success rate but what is the percentage of people that you're talking to on here that will come and meet um depends on how long you talk to them and if you can convince them that you're not a police officer would you say the majority of them way more than the majority yeah 90 yeah over 90 percent 

um it depends if they ask to meet or not yet because sometimes it takes a while for them to chat so I would say yeah like if they if they ask to meet 90 95 plus if they are asked to meet up 95 you think yeah damn how did how did project Veritas get involved with it um they saw the a viral podcast and me talking about the website and they were interested and they said well I want to help you bring Justice to this uh to to 

what the other stations failed to to bring Justice to and the FBI even failed to or all everybody everybody failed me I felt like they failed me and project Veritas said hey we will do something about this we'll put our whole team on it we're going to we're gonna we're gonna bring light to this we're gonna bring these people out of the dark corners of the earth and uh and it made me feel like okay I have I have a team here you know I have people that are 

willing to you know fly across the country and meet me in a 24-hour notice which they did to have a conversation they they flew me out to New York to to do an interview um you know just off my word you know I could have been lying I could have been a member that's who knows what they what they didn't know who I was so they just took my word for it and they gave me the most compassion and love that more compassionate love than I would have ever expected and still are to this day what is this collaboration between 

mu and them look like how are they are you you're obviously feeding them all the information that you've uncovered so far you're still getting more information um so no so right now we're going off the data that I already have which is so much um especially with Nathan Larson's websites you know right the one we're focusing on at the moment is rapey.co and Dot t-o so anyone that was on that list is going to be investigated we have 

all of their information or ways to find it so we're just going to go down that list keep exposing them in person um and uh we've found quite a few already so it's it's only going to get more extreme especially as the team gets bigger and hopefully we do some justice put some more in prison uh uncover some secrets how are you getting how are you guys so they sent me so this interview is timed perfectly we when project Veritas starts 

to release this information we're right behind them we've talked to them we're collaborating with them we want to just dump gas and amplify what you guys are doing to get this word out so what does this collaboration look like between you and them you're feeding them the information and then how are they reaching out to these guys and and how are they getting to them to come in and and confess to this stuff 

um they so they have their own ways of dealing with undercover uh operations and and like filming Undercover uh but when we find the information on the people you know we're going off the database we're taking the information per user we're tying that to what we you know we have some some archived images of when the website did exist so we could say this user said this at this time or replied to this at that time figure out who that user is and then organize a team to go out there and meet 

them but the process of finding out who they are is called ocent or open source intelligence and project Veritas has been doing that already for years as well as me as I specialize in in Ocean and and obviously being a hacker it just comes with the comes with the territory um so working together as a team finding these people has been you know no different than what I would do on a daily basis except it's just making a bigger impact how many guys have you guys put in prison so far 

um I don't think I can talk about that part yet okay yeah we'll wait let's talk about the John Lewis confrontation yep he was on rapey.to website with his email link to it he says he found the website through a telegram group yeah first he admits to having a fetish to young children went to therapy for help with that addiction has gone has been 

going for many years and has made a little progress with his addiction addiction to porn right yeah yeah do you want to talk about that interview at all have you seen that yeah I watched the interview and uh the guy is in a facility for his addiction to porn but was completely cognizant and coherent or you know he's not he wasn't like a mental health case to like where he couldn't he didn't know right from wrong he definitely was fully aware of what he was doing um he like I said he's one of seven 

thousand on that list but he did admit on an undercover camera that um that you know he was to child he was soliciting and that he was a member of not only but those telegram groups I mentioned earlier that were you know trading and soliciting admit all of that clear as day on camera so that will be forwarded forwarded along to the police and uh we'll see what happens from there but that was 

very recent his confrontation the application question to join the group we've already gone over this if a man wants his three-year-old daughter in every while she is do you have a problem with that please elaborate on your thought process so we can better judge your suitability for this site John Lewis's response I do have a problem with that that's disgusting then they expose the conversation make a 

video in the school basement denied it it was a lie denied received past he only admits to having seen but did not distribute it and then and then confessed who have looked or seen images never physically acting on those urges and then later confessed 

right and and says that he never did any of that uh and if what he says that he did on the Forum he legitimately says that he's a kid in the basement across from the school and just by chance that's where he lives across from a school where his parents live so you know he could he could say he didn't or he did but the fact that he admitted to like I've been in some very very tough 

spots in my life but I've never thought about a child ever that's and I I doubt you have either it's it's a if I don't trust anything you say yeah you know so if you tell me on a forum the kid in the basement you probably in the basement that's that's what I'm gonna safely assume do you know what happened to this guy that's like I said so that one's so new 

that I'm not sure what's gonna happen to him but hopefully he's still out there right now though yeah yeah how do we solve this man there's no way to solve it for sure like you know it's never going to go away and unfortunately we have some states that are trying to normalize it we have to stay sort of trying to make it a sexual orientation um and then we have other states what states uh California being the main one that I know of what are they doing they're trying to make it a sexual 

orientation I think they're calling it uh something attracted minors or something or uh they're making it okay we need to accept so now we need to accept people who are little kids yes that's what they're trying to do accept that now yeah California is one state that they're trying to make it part of a sexuality to be attracted to children it's just it's 

a sexuality to be attracted to Children you know any other states that are doing this I could Google it but in California is uh is the main one that I know of not surprising yeah not surprising not surprising at all yeah so that's that blows my mind that that's even a thought and then there's people that defend these guys it's a mental illness it's a sickness it's this it's that I don't care what it is because it affects somebody else you know it's gonna ruin somebody's life forever um why do you think these states are 

pushing the ship I don't know I don't know but Florida I'll give you a good example I mean descent this is trying to pass a bill to uh to issue the death penalty for for the sex crimes against children from what I understand that's in place is that in place is it locked in I mean it must have been recent if so but I don't want to misspeak but the way I understood it is that it is in there now and that if you're doing this and you get caught they're going to kill you I love 

that why why is it that should be the case everywhere my opinion why are all the Democrat States trying to legalize this and make this normal I don't understand that I don't know I don't know how you can vote for that I don't know how you can affiliate with that I don't know how you can think it's okay it's  disgusting yeah yeah I agree with you I agree with you it's like you know 

kids yeah they're creating people and people voting this in yeah Newsome Gavin Newsom got recalled and they voted him in again and look at this  now he's making this normal I mean I hate to get political but what the is wrong with these people I agree with you very it's uh I I can't explain I wish I could I wish I could explain why we just got a message in 10 seconds in a random 

chat room from a 47 year old man wanting to but uh I can't I I have no explanation and all I know is that we need to find a way for parents to be educated and for kids when they get old enough to be educated um so that this doesn't happen to them now that's that's all I know that I could do and uh the only other thing I know I could do outside of educating parents schools uh children is uh is you know help some some you know 

organizations out that the human trafficking and you know victims of any type of sexual assault whether they're children or adults like uh I have the resources and the team and the the skill set to be able to help people I just need those people to be put in place as well as let's say parents monitoring their child on an app you know I have some ideas in my head for apps but I don't want to plug a specific app if I don't know if it's great or if I can trust them so you know even if you don't plug even if you don't plug an app rhyme 

what do these apps do like so if I put this app on my son's phone what do I get so you're gonna know where he's at at all times you'll be able to read his text messages you'll be able to check his app usage he'd be able to you know lock down certain parts of the phone that you don't want them to to be on um and you know just basically as if you have access to the phone but you have more access than him it's it's really more I think it's more important to do that and have your kid aggravated at you then 

like I said the the latter yeah I mean I would 100 agree with you so basically the statistics with the like the the one in ten people before the age of 18 are are sexually assaulted and 40 are 12 years old or under I didn't know that yeah I mean that's 40 40 or under 12. so it's important to do this stuff you know so with these apps so the way I'm 

understanding what you're saying is if I put one of these apps on anybody's phone I basically get control just like you were talking about earlier people's computer I can control everything they're doing it's like a commercial remote access Trojan how easy is it to to manipulate the app I mean because here's my concern I'm getting old and my son's gonna be a lot more tech savvy than I am right so he's going to 

learn how to defeat that yeah for sure so I don't think that it's going to be easy as of right now I know it's not easy I know of one that my uh my uncle is using and it hasn't been beaten by uh by his daughter so uh you know I I don't think it'll be that easy nothing's impossible but uh you know they could always get on a computer which is other ways to protect the computer if it was me as a kid maybe I'd get a little more crafty because you know that's what I like to do I like to hack computers 

um but I don't know it would it would stop me and make me second guess what I was doing if I knew my parents or a parent was watching everything that I was doing online I would second guess my conversations and who I talked to damn man this is because like I'll give you one example um a guy uh a guy was talking to our decoy this is like the second or third person that we caught talking to our decoy in a normal chat room not like that like a like you 

know regular social media site and was using a photo of some guy that was in a band as a profile photo using a fake phone number fake age and a fake name and we were like we can't find information on them like we can meet up with them but we're not gonna know anything about the guy so we eventually got the decoy to get the guy to send pictures of his face and um you send some real pictures of his face I was able to find him on the internet found a real name found you know that he was not the age that he 

said not the name that he said that he wasn't even using his real photos he booked a hotel room um a hotel room he ordered I even actually ordered pizza to the hotel room thinking that he was meeting with an 11 year old at that time and uh it's you know you gotta remember that the 11 year old he thought he was talking to was under the assumption they were meeting some guy from a band that was younger that got a hotel for the night that just ordered pizza when in reality it's some guy in his mid-40s 

it's it's an unbelievably messed up let's take a break I need a break hey guys let me tell you about this subscription service that I've been working real hard on called vigilance Elite patreon basically on patreon we have it broken up into three different tiers we 

got tier one tier two and tier three let's Dive In our Tier 1 patrons get all the behind the scenes footage of the Sean Ryan show that could include behind the scenes photos that could be side conversations that we have in between breaks that could be specific questions that our patrons give us for the guests on the Sean Ryan Show and a ton of bonus content that doesn't really fit into any specific category for our tier 2 patrons they get access 

to our tactical training Library which consists of well over a hundred videos we've broken those videos up into separate categories and those categories are rifle fundamentals pistol fundamentals drills tactics driving gear and weapon setups and everybody's favorite mindset also on tier two you will get a live update from me on the first and the 15th 

of every month where we talk about the upcoming guests on the Sean Ryan Show plus all the benefits of tier one our top tier which is tier three gets full access to all the other tiers plus they get full access to me where we do video teleconferencing VTC once a month we discuss anything from tactics to current events to who's coming on the show I 

take suggestions and it's very interactive no matter what tier you choose the support is greatly appreciated and it is the only thing that makes this show drive on so thank you for all the support see you on patreon all right Ryan we're back from the break sorry man I had to is getting a little too angry before the break so I wanted to I understand wanted to cool off for a minute but while we were on the break I 

want to clear a couple things up we were talking about the California law and the Florida law so we printed some stuff up this is from the Liberty Champion I didn't realize this got this got this stuff in California got signed into law in 2020. right yeah I don't know you know God knows what more they've done since then yeah who knows I know the lgbtq plus Community from what it says in one of those articles they were not 

happy at all about this decision so it seems they're not in support of uh or at least the lgbtq movement is not in support of the sexual or uh sexually attracted to minors or men I can't I can't remember plus is that what this is I believe so but I don't want to I don't want to be wrong yeah let's let's just stick to what we know so I'm just going to read this this is uh a report from the Liberty Champion it is an opinion poll I think this uh portion is factual you 

can look it up uh we're on a time crunch so whatever look it up but according to this a couple weeks ago this is dated October 12 2020. a couple weeks ago California governor Gavin Newsom signed a law that would allow judges to decide whether or not to list someone as a sex offender for having or with a minor according to the bill it only applies to consensual sex whether it be 

between a minor 14 years old or or older so as long as they're 14 you're good in California well I guess I guess it's up to the judge it's up to the judge and they believe that children can consent at that age um and then from just you know from what I know just hearing things or reading things that there is a stick they want 

to make it a sexuality in certain States one being California that you're attracted to minors overall um and I don't believe kids can consent personally not in the slightest this this goes on to say yeah it looks like this is an opinion poll so I don't want to get too but far in the weeds but yeah it looks like they're adding it to the lgbtq plus community miners deserve the right to consensual 

sex too no it's ridiculous that's not for me that's from this right I totally disagree with this I agree somebody tries to make a weird sound yeah I don't agree with it either but uh then we go and then the Florida thing this is April 20th 2023 this is from ABC News they're really upset about this uh if you read the whole article but Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Thursday signed a bill that 

will allow juries to impose the death sentence even if all 12 jurors do not agree he is also likely to approve a second bill passed by the lawmakers on Tuesday next Tuesday that would make sexual battery of a 12 year old of I'm sorry sexual battery of a child under the age of 12 a death penalty offense it's quite the difference between the uh two states there I agreed I know where I'd want to live yeah I and I do live in 

Florida and and totally agree with uh what he's what he's trying to do I still I just can't believe people are into this you know yeah I do it I do it every day and uh I still can't believe it but um so we're gonna kind of wrap things up here there's a couple of things that we haven't talked about yet I know you got a couple of facts uh statistics that you want to Rattle off before we get to that real quick let's go over a couple of examples on our break you were talking about uh 

confronting a man in Delray Beach yes who then was later caught and then we also talked about a letter that you got from a I don't want to say a gentleman's attorney a pedophiles attorney right uh basically standing up for him trying to pay you I'll I'll leave it to you from here let's start with let's start with the guy um the the video as of this as of recording now isn't isn't on our YouTube channel but um by the time this this is released 

people will be able to watch this this man's video um he showed up after talking to our decoy and you know talking sexually um he was fully aware of the age uh and he he I looked you know I looked into the guy the guy went to school to be a teacher he has a bachelor's in in teaching a a teaching to some degree I don't know what specific topic or if teaching is just a degree but he is a teacher he taught at two different 

schools what schools um I have them uh on my computer I don't have them off top of my head local Florida schools uh one is an online tutor school and another one's not so uh but he has two two properties one in Massachusetts and one in Florida uh he showed up to meet um his name was Brent and um I walked up to him with the camera uh Scrappy behind me and we called his name and uh the guy just starts walking away while he's on the phone with our decoy 

and um we're like hey we have all your information we know where you live we know you're like we uh you know instead of just saying we know where you live or giving them the address we're telling them what you know his name we're telling him where he's worked we tell him the age like this guy knew that we knew who he was and he kept walking and kept walking then he goes into a full Sprint he's full sprinting through the Walmart and you know I'm not a big Runner so I just start chasing after him you know I'm running as fast as I can to uh to catch up with him I got the camera 

in my hand and I'm screaming at the guy saying you know what are you what are you doing here like what's going through your head guy gets in his car he drives away didn't get a word out of the guy so we thought okay let's just report it to the police we'll put the video up it'll just be a short video we'll attach some of the chat logs so people see he was a teacher and um I thought that was the end of it a couple days later uh I get a text message from a friend that says hey didn't you just catch this guy uh her name's Courtney Elizabeth she's a 

predator catcher she uh she texted me a screenshot from another Predator catcher 1200 miles away in Pennsylvania so we're in Florida originally this guy is drove to Pennsylvania for whatever reason I don't know why he was there if he was on his way to Massachusetts I don't know what he was doing there but got caught again by another Predator catching group and um and I I reached out to that that Predator catcher uh Luzerne County Predator catcher he just he does his County and is known in that specific 

area and he sent me all the chat logs one of the chat logs said that he was chased out of Walmart by two police officers and the guy has no idea who we were because we didn't get a chance to say you know we didn't get to get a chance to even tell them what we were doing tell them what we were doing um so just you know the point of the matter is he didn't get the point the first time he likely ran from Florida because he thought he was being investigated or wanted by the police and 

then you also have to think if he got caught twice by two uh Predator catchers which is not the most common you know profession or niche in the world um how many times this man hasn't been has not been caught so it's disgusting you know that he's a teacher and discussing that he'd do it twice but just think of the amount of times this man has probably not been caught so that was that was one thing and then we caught another guy that I wanted to I wanted to reference um we caught another guy 

um named Stephen who he went to his job we asked for him what was his job uh he was uh he's a manager at a seafood restaurant and we showed up there we sat at the table he was supposed to meet with with our decoy at that point uh it was 13 or 14 years old uh my memory serves me correctly um and uh he bailed last second that day a lot of times these guys will Bell and then they'll come back or you know it 

they never really disappear because they can't they can't control themselves this guy was very sexual he said that he wanted uh he wanted our decoy to sit on his face he wanted her to come back to his house horrible things so we were like you know what we're not gonna let this guy just bail and disappear we know where he works we have his information let's just go there order two glasses of water we know he's the manager so he'll come up after we request the manager and we'll bring him outside and have a conversation so we did that he was fully aware that he was being recorded and uh everything that uh everything you know 

was it was very transparent what was going on you know we asked questions he told us the answers to them he knew we weren't police he knew he was free to go at any time and he offered a ton of info nation that was up to him so uh you know that gets over with police come we give the police all the information that we have and some time goes by and I get a an email which the original email was uh you know saying to take the video down off of the off of 

the internet and uh it went originally that went to Scrappy's cell phone um and he didn't see it at first but then when he did he saw he sent it to me and then I replied to it but the first email was straight to the point like take this video down uh it's in a violation of this statute of the privacy laws of Florida and last time I checked you can record in public um you know it's you have no expectation of privacy in a public place uh audio or video and uh so I wasn't too concerned 

about the threat from the law firm who's representing our Predator um so I sent the reply back and I said take a look at the person that you are representing here are the chat logs if you want if you want to be clear um because I didn't release them with video so the attorney could read all of the horrible things that the guy not only admitted in the video but uh but that he said himself in the chats with pictures of his face then they reply a few days later and I'll read you their reply they said thank you for your response in accordance with Florida 

statute 934.03 we are requesting that you remove the video as stated in my previous email this video is exposing Mr blank to an increased risk of physical harm in the video you have exposed this face and full name without his consent which is a violation of privacy laws see below and then this is from the statute in Florida it's illegal to record an in-person or telephone conversation without the consent of all parties violating this law constitutes either a misdemeanor or 

third degree felony depending on the offender's intent and conviction history can also subject subject the offender to civil damages and then at the bottom this is the kicker we respect everything that you do and acknowledge your mission of doing what is right and protecting the public in fact we would like to offer you one thousand dollars to support your cause and for the administrative costs for the removal I will also be at your service if you need our help in the future if 

you face any legal issues with your channel again we're not looking for a battle we're looking for your help respectfully blank so I will not release their firm's name uh I don't respect the fact that they're representing a predator but uh they haven't filed a lawsuit against me at this point if they do this email is is in my possession it was sent to me I can release this email it's not a threat by any means but I will release it to let the public know that you know somebody's representing a 

predator and trying to make my life and Scrappy's life more difficult um you know about exposing a local predator and then number two the fact that they said that they would want to represent us why would we ever want legal advice from somebody that would take prob most likely 500 bucks from a predator to take down a video that is educating the people in the area who's dangerous why would we want to be represented by somebody that's okay with that yeah so um I just wanted to like let you know 

that one I blew my mind this stuff just goes on and on and on and and run I want to get you back here again to dive into this more maybe in six months or so because I know there's going to be a bunch of stuff that develops but yeah so I know you have a couple of Statistics you want to Rattle off and um let's rattle those off and then let's try to end this with some with something positive okay yeah agreed so these are just uh you know just some 

some uh statistics about human trafficking which goes you know is goes it coincides with exactly what we're doing catching predators and and these pedophile ring websites um one in five uh uh us teenagers who have received an unwanted sexual solicitation online that's crimes against children Research Center um uh 13 year old 13 years old is the average age at which a child first encounters an explicit uh website which 

comes from guard child 75 percent of children are willing to share personal information with strangers that comes from e-safety commissioner 75 75 percent fifty percent of sexual exploitation incidents involving children that begin to begin on social media platforms what was that percentage 50 they begin which I believe is higher yeah um 27 of online child exploitation cases involving a perpetrator who is a family 

member or acquaintance um Source National Center for missing exploited children the people that ignored me um but yeah 27 of people uh are cases involving family members and acquaintances which I think that number's higher too so they're just statistics they're not always accurate um but either way they're still horrible regardless of which way you look at it yeah you know it's it's something to try to wrap your head around and and and 

understand the severity and how much this happens but moving on let's get into some good news let's let's talk about how we solve this thing which seems when you look at it and and you see you can enter just any chat room and somebody shows up in five seconds to literally within 10 seconds we had that message or it might have been five yeah we'll find out and um yeah we'll find 

out when the video uh when we edit but but you know they're just to bring some hope to people you know we we actually videographer came up with a with a grade option at least a start and um he was saying you make a database you know we pull all of your information intelligence that you've yanked out of these out of these sites and hopefully you'll continue to exploit 

these sites uh with that information and make a database a public database that has all the people that are associated with these sites names addresses pictures if we can get them all of it and then people schools um businesses people that are looking to hire parents anybody can just go under this database type in a name see if it pops up or a face or a face yeah or both 

um I think I think that's a phenomenal idea yeah of course I mean like we were saying on the Break um you know it's not like these people are are Innocent by like there's no there's no possible chance of them being innocent there's chat logs of them talking sexually to what they believe is a minor and then there's video evidence of them showing up there at the time they say they're going to be there most of the time on the phone with what they think as a child while they're walking 

through the store or through a public place to meet who they think is a kid so the the database of you know if a cop can't you know if a cop can't get a charge to stick where the state attorney doesn't want to go go through with the case uh well then the public should know regardless because then they can make their decision based on the evidence that was gathered by the public you know I I don't know what the legalities would be either but if you are an attorney 

who knows this subject and you want to help reach out to zero day reach out to project Veritas reach out to us yeah uh all those links will be in the description but yeah I think that would be you know what else I think we should shame the attorneys who are representing Predators yeah yeah I think it's ridiculous I mean there's no money in the world that you could pay me to get rid of this information to 

stop the journey that I'm on right now I don't care what you offered me it's not happening it's it's not worth it there's I care too much about kids I don't even have a kid and you know again off the break I said I can't you know I don't know how I'm gonna act when I have a kid I'm already crazy and you know it's about my friend's kids you know like I'm I'm gonna be I need to find a balance between being a crazy parent and uh and you know and letting my kid have their own space because I I'm just I'm terrified yeah me too you know 

I don't I just I don't even the stuff really gets to me and and when we connected I told you my goal this year is to dive into this subject and bring a lot of awareness to it and man this eats me alive you know but and then you read stuff like what California's doing and then and it's it's I mean they're they're making this a we're trying to normalize it so if 

you're a pedo moved to California right yeah you're not down with that move out of California it's getting to be that simple you know they're gonna look what's going on there you know yeah everything the whole anyways whatever but um you know I wanna I really want your word to get out and I want to I want to connect you with some people I want to connect you with my friend Matt Murphy uh who's doing operation light shine he's making a huge 

dent in this stuff I think I think How This Ends obviously government's not going to get involved right uh especially in particular States I guess uh Florida is getting involved Florida might yeah but um but whatever government moves as slow as a snail so I think what it's going to be is it's going to be this collaborative effort from citizens people like you people like Matt Murphy um going after these guys there's other organizations out there and it's this 

big collapse turning into this big collaborative effort you know to get rid of these people and expose what they're doing and educate the public on how to keep your kids safe and just Ryan just with what you're doing I think I may have brought this up at the beginning but I mean if you think about the impact that you're having you know you're educating kids kids are going to wise up to this stuff that's going to drop the numbers parents are going to be listening to this 

they're going to wise up to this that's going to drop numbers predators are going to watch this and realize we're coming for them and they are heavily and they're going to get scared and some of them are going to stop so just by doing this show this one show it's gonna stop it's gonna stop a handful it's gonna It's Gonna Save at least one kid okay one kid is good with me I want to also actually I already 

sent the text but I want to introduce you to a podcast that's um they do phenomenal work it's called concrete uh it's run uh their host is a guy named Danny Jones I think he's somewhere in the Tampa area okay I'd love to connect you with him I haven't I haven't even met him in person but I'm a huge fan of their podcast that's one that I watched I think I've actually seen stuff I've seen it with uh I met one of the uh one of the guys oh good yeah I didn't meet any of the uh any of 

the I'm sorry the uh producers of the show somebody that was interviewed um he was a fraud guy but oh yeah well I'd like to introduce you to them because I think they'll I think they will have the courage to help you get the word out and there's another guy uh Julian Dorian who I'm actually going on his show here pretty soon and I want to make that connection too because that guy he does some really really really good work and
