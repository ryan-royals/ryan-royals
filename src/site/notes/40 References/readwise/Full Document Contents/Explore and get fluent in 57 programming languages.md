##### You donâ€™t know what you donâ€™t know

When learning a new language, the hardest part is not being aware of the gaps in your knowledge. Our mentors can look at your code and immediately see the ideas you're not familiar with and give you a level-up by unlocking new knowledge.

Becoming fluent in a language is more than being able to write code in it - it's about being able to think in that language. Our mentors will help guide you to how to reshape your thinking to write idiomatic code.

Getting feedback from real people is an amazingly exciting way to learn. And becoming a mentor and giving feedback yourself is an even bigger step forward. So complete the circle - be mentored and mentor ðŸŽ‰
