[![Building in the clouds image](https://github.com/copilot-workshops/copilot-terraform/raw/main/assets/Terraform-image.png)](https://github.com/copilot-workshops/copilot-terraform/blob/main/assets/Terraform-image.png)
In this fun workshop, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to help you work with Terraform files.

Estimated time to complete: `10 to 45 minutes`

Participants will be guided to install the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension, follow a CodeTour to learn how to interact with GitHub Copilot, and then use GitHub Copilot to update, document and create Terraform files.

#### Running a workshop?

If you're planning to run a GitHub Copilot workshop, please review the [workshop guide](https://github.com/copilot-workshops/copilot-terraform/blob/main/.instructions/workshop%20organisers.md) for tips and tricks to help you run a successful workshop.

#### Project Structure

In this project you will find:

* a `variables.tf` file we'll use to influence Copilot's suggestions
* a `main.tf` file that contains a Terraform module that creates a resource group in Azure
* a devcontainer that installs CodeTour and GitHub Copilot when the Codespace is created (If you want to use Codespaces)
* a `.instructions` folder all the instructions for this workshop.
* an `assets` folder containing images used in this workshop documentation.
* a `.tours` folder that includes the CodeTour file if you wish to use it.

#### FAQ

* **How do I get a GitHub Copilot license?**
	+ You can request a trial license from your GitHub Sales representative or via Copilot for Individuals or Business licenses.
* **How do I get a GitHub Codespaces license?**
	+ Codespaces is included with GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GitHub Free. You can check under your [billing settings page](https://github.com/settings/billing).
* **I am having trouble activating GitHub Copilot after I load the plugin, what should I do?**
	+ This could be because you launched your Codespace before you activated GitHub Copilot or accepted the invitation to the trial org. Please try to reload your Codespace and try again.
