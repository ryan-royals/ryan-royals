### Microsoft Azure Arc Community Monthly Meetup

[![Arc](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc_community/raw/main/img/arc.png)](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc_community/blob/main/img/arc.png)
#### Overview

Once a month, the various Azure Hybrid Cloud product groups at Microsoft will hold a call to showcase new features, talk through important topics and engage in a Q&A regarding Azure Arc. The foundational goals of the call are highlighted below:

* Provide the Azure Arc community with product updates
* Host a short talk and/or demo on Azure Hybrid Cloud technologies and products technologies
* Collect feedback from the community on issues, blockers, use cases, and questions related to Azure Hybrid Cloud technologies and products

#### Who is the "community"?

If you are a customer, partner, Microsoft employee, or just someone who loves tech, for us, you are part of our community. The content presented in our calls is **not under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA)** and is public because our mission is just to spread the ❤️ for Azure Hybrid Cloud solutions and technologies.

#### Meetup agenda

Each monthly meetup will be 1 hour, don't be late, we have a lot to cover 🤓

* 2 minutes: Welcome
* 45-50 minutes: Product updates
* 5-10 minutes: “Ask us anything” and feedback discussion
