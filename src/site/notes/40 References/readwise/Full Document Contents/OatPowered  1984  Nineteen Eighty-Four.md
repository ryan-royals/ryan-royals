The **list of security hacking incidents** covers important or noteworthy events in the history of [security hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker) and [cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hackercracker).

 1900

 1903

* Magician and inventor [Nevil Maskelyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevil_Maskelyne_(magician)) disrupts [John Ambrose Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ambrose_Fleming)'s public demonstration of [Guglielmo Marconi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi)'s purportedly secure [wireless telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy) technology, sending insulting [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) messages through the auditorium's projector.1(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-1)

 1930s

 1932

* Polish cryptologists [Marian Rejewski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Rejewski), [Henryk Zygalski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_Zygalski) and Jerzy Różycki broke the [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma) code.

 1939

* [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), [Gordon Welchman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Welchman) and [Harold Keen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Keen) worked together to develop the [Bombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe) (on the basis of Rejewski's works on [Bomba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_(cryptography))). The [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)'s use of a reliably small key space makes it vulnerable to brute force.

 1940s

 1943

* [René Carmille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Carmille), [comptroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller) general of the [Vichy French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_France) Army, hacked the [punched card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) system used by the Nazis to locate Jews.2(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Davis-2)

 1949

* The theory that underlies computer viruses was first made public in 1949, when computer pioneer [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) presented a paper titled "Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata". In the paper, von Neumann speculated that computer programs could reproduce themselves.3(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-3)

 1950s

 1955

* At [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT), "hack" first came to mean playing with machines. The minutes of an April 1955 meeting of the [Tech Model Railroad Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club) state that "Mr. Eccles requests that anyone working or hacking on the electrical system turn the power off to avoid fuse blowing."4(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-4)

 1957

* Joe "[Joybubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joybubbles)" Engressia, a blind seven-year-old boy with perfect pitch, discovered that whistling the fourth E above middle C (a frequency of 2600 Hz) would interfere with AT&T's automated telephone systems, thereby inadvertently opening the door for [phreaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking).

 1960s

* Various [phreaking boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking_boxes) are used to interact with automated telephone systems.

 1963

* The first ever reference to malicious [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker) is '[telephone hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking)' in [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology)'s student newspaper, *The Tech* of hackers tying up the lines with [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University), configuring the [PDP-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1) to make free calls, [war dialing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_dialing) and accumulating large phone bills.5(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-5)6(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-6)7(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-7)

 1965

* William D. Mathews from [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT) found a vulnerability in a **[CTSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System)** running on an [IBM 7094](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7094). The standard text editor on the system was designed to be used by one user at a time, working in one directory, and so it created a temporary file with a constant name for all instantiations of the editor. The flaw was discovered when two system programmers were editing at the same time and the temporary files for the message of the day and the password file became swapped, causing the contents of the system CTSS password file to display to any user logging into the system.8(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-8)9(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-9)10(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-10)11(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-11)

 1967

* The first known incidence of network penetration hacking took place when members of a computer club at a suburban Chicago area high school were provided access to IBM's [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) network. In the Fall of 1967, IBM (through [Science Research Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Research_Associates)) approached [Evanston Township High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanston_Township_High_School) with the offer of four [2741 Selectric teletypewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_2741)-based terminals with dial-up modem connectivity to an experimental computer system which implemented an early version of the APL programming language. The APL network system was structured into Workspaces which were assigned to various clients using the system. Working independently, the students quickly learned the language and the system. They were free to explore the system, often using existing code available in public Workspaces as models for their own creations. Eventually, curiosity drove the students to explore the system's wider context. This first informal network penetration effort was later acknowledged as helping harden the security of one of the first publicly accessible networks:12(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-12)
> Science Research Associates undertook to write a full APL system for the [IBM 1500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1500). They modeled their system after [APL/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL%5C360), which had by that time been developed and seen substantial use inside of IBM, using code borrowed from MAT/1500 where possible. In their documentation, they acknowledge their gratitude to "a number of high school students for their compulsion to bomb the system". This was an early example of a kind of sportive, but very effective, debugging that was often repeated in the evolution of APL systems.

 1970s

 1971

* [John T. Draper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper) (later nicknamed Captain Crunch), his friend Joe Engressia (also known as [Joybubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joybubbles)), and [blue box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box) phone [phreaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking) hit the news with an *[Esquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine))* magazine feature story.13(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-13)

 1979

* [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick) breaks into his first major computer system, the Ark, the computer system [Digital Equipment Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation) (DEC) used for developing their [RSTS/E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSTS/E) operating system software.14(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-14)

 1980s

 1980

* The [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI) investigates a breach of security at [National CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_CSS) (NCSS). *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*, reporting on the incident in 1981, describes hackers as15(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-mclellan19810726-15)

> technical experts, skilled, often young, computer programmers who almost whimsically probe the defenses of a computer system, searching out the limits and the possibilities of the machine. Despite their seemingly subversive role, hackers are a recognized asset in the computer industry, often highly prized.
> 
> 

The newspaper describes [white hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)) activities as part of a "mischievous but perversely positive 'hacker' tradition". When a National CSS employee revealed the existence of his [password cracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracker), which he had used on customer accounts, the company chastised him not for writing the software but for not disclosing it sooner. The letter of reprimand stated that "The Company realizes the benefit to NCSS and in fact encourages the efforts of employees to identify security weaknesses to the VP, the directory, and other sensitive software in files".15(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-mclellan19810726-15)
 1981

* [Chaos Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club) forms in Germany.
* Ian Murphy, aka Captain Zap, was the first cracker to be tried and convicted as a felon. Murphy broke into AT&T's computers in 1981 and changed the internal clocks that metered billing rates. People were getting late-night discount rates when they called at midday. Of course, the bargain-seekers who waited until midnight to call long distance were hit with high bills.16(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-16)

 1983

* [The 414s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_414s) break into 60 computer systems at institutions ranging from the [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory) to Manhattan's [Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Sloan-Kettering_Cancer_Center).17(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-drzmzu-17) The incident appeared as the cover story of *[Newsweek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek)* with the title "Beware: Hackers at play".18(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-iophas-18) As a result, the U.S. House of Representatives held hearings on computer security and passed several laws.
* The group [KILOBAUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.H.I.R.M.) is formed in February, kicking off a series of other hacker groups that formed soon after.
* The movie *[WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames)* introduces the wider public to the phenomenon of hacking and creates a degree of mass paranoia about hackers and their supposed abilities to bring the world to a screeching halt by launching nuclear [ICBMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICBM).19(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-19)
* The [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives) begins hearings on computer security hacking.20(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-20)
* In his [Turing Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award) lecture, [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) mentions "hacking" and describes a security exploit that he calls a "[Trojan horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing))".21(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-21)

 1984

* Someone calling himself [Lex Luthor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Luthor) founds the [Legion of Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Doom_(hacking)). Named after a Saturday morning cartoon, the LOD had the reputation of attracting "the best of the best"—until one of the most talented members called [Phiber Optik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phiber_Optik) feuded with Legion of Doomer [Erik Bloodaxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Bloodaxe_(hacker)) and got 'tossed out of the clubhouse'. Phiber's friends formed a rival group, the [Masters of Deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Deception).
* The [Comprehensive Crime Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Crime_Control_Act) gives the Secret Service jurisdiction over [computer fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_fraud).
* [Cult of the Dead Cow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow) forms in [Lubbock, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubbock,_Texas), and begins publishing its [ezine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_ezine).
* The [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)) magazine *2600* begins regular publication, right when [TAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technical_Assistance_Program&action=edit&redlink=1) was putting out its final issue. The editor of *2600*, "[Emmanuel Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein)" (whose real name is [Eric Corley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Corley)), takes his handle from the leader of the resistance in [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell)'s *[Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)*. The publication provides tips for would-be hackers and phone phreaks, as well as commentary on the hacker issues of the day. Today, copies of *2600* are sold at most large retail bookstores.
* The [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress), the annual European hacker conference organized by the [Chaos Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club), is held in [Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg), Germany.
* [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson)'s groundbreaking science fiction novel *[Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer)*, about "Case", a futuristic computer hacker, is published. Considered the first major [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk) novel, it brought into hacker jargon such terms as "[cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace)", "the matrix", "simstim", and "[ICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_Countermeasures_Electronics)".

 1985

* [KILOBAUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.H.I.R.M.) is re-organized into The [P.H.I.R.M.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.H.I.R.M.) and begins [sysopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysop) hundreds of [BBSs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.
* The online 'zine *[Phrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrack)* is established.
* *[The Hacker's Handbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hacker%27s_Handbook)* is published in the UK.22(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-22)
* The FBI, Secret Service, Middlesex County NJ Prosecutor's Office and various local law enforcement agencies execute seven search warrants concurrently across New Jersey on July 12, 1985, seizing equipment from BBS operators and users alike for "complicity in computer theft",23(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-23) under a newly passed, and yet untested criminal statute.24(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-24) This is famously known as the Private Sector Bust,25(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-25) or the 2600 BBS Seizure,26(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-26) and implicated the Private Sector BBS sysop, Store Manager (also a BBS sysop), Beowulf, Red Barchetta, The Vampire, the NJ Hack Shack BBS sysop, and the Treasure Chest BBS sysop.

 1986

* After more and more break-ins to [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government) and [corporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation) computers, Congress passes the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act), which makes it a crime to break into computer systems. The law, however, does not cover juveniles.27(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-27)
* [Robert Schifreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schifreen) and [Stephen Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Gold) are convicted of accessing the [Telecom Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecom_Gold) account belonging to the [Duke of Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh) under the [Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery_and_Counterfeiting_Act_1981) in the United Kingdom, the first conviction for illegally accessing a computer system. On appeal, the conviction is overturned as hacking is not within the legal definition of forgery.28(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-28)
* Arrest of a hacker who calls himself The Mentor. He published a now-famous treatise shortly after his arrest that came to be known as the [Hacker Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Manifesto) in the e-zine [Phrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrack). This still serves as the most famous piece of hacker literature and is frequently used to illustrate the mindset of hackers.
* Astronomer [Clifford Stoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll) plays a pivotal role in tracking down hacker [Markus Hess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Hess), events later covered in Stoll's 1990 book *[The Cuckoo's Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg)*.29(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-29)

 1987

* The [Christmas Tree EXEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Tree_EXEC) "worm" causes major disruption to the [VNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNET), [BITNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITNET) and [EARN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Academic_Research_Network) networks.30(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-30)

 1988

* The *[Morris Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Worm)*. Graduate student Robert T. Morris, Jr. of Cornell University launches a worm on the government's ARPAnet (precursor to the Internet).31(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-31)32(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-32) The worm spreads to 6,000 networked computers, clogging government and university systems. Robert Morris is dismissed from Cornell, sentenced to three years' probation, and fined $10,000.33(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-33)
* [First National Bank of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_National_Bank_of_Chicago) is the victim of $70 million computer theft.
* The [Computer Emergency Response Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERT_Coordination_Center) (CERT) is created by [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA) to address [network security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security).
* The [Father Christmas (computer worm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Christmas_(computer_worm)) spreads over [DECnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECnet) networks.

 1989

* [Jude Milhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Milhon) (aka St Jude) and [R. U. Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._U._Sirius) launch *[MONDO 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MONDO_2000)*, a major '90s tech-lifestyle magazine, in [Berkeley, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California).
* The politically motivated [WANK worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WANK_(computer_worm)) spreads over [DECnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECnet).
* Dutch magazine [Hack-Tic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack-Tic) begins.
* [The Cuckoo's Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg) by Clifford Stoll is published.
* The detection of [AIDS (Trojan horse)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_(Trojan_horse)) is the first instance of a ransomware detection.

 1990s

 1990

* [Operation Sundevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sundevil) introduced. After a prolonged sting investigation, Secret Service agents swoop down on organizers and prominent members of BBSs in 14 U.S. cities including the [Legion of Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Doom_(hacking)), conducting early-morning raids and arrests. The arrests involve and are aimed at cracking down on credit-card theft and telephone and wire fraud. The result is a breakdown in the hacking community, with members informing on each other in exchange for immunity. The offices of [Steve Jackson Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jackson_Games) are also raided, and the [role-playing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) sourcebook [GURPS Cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Cyberpunk) is confiscated, possibly because the government fears it is a "handbook for computer crime". Legal battles arise that prompt the formation of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation), including the trial of [Knight Lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Neidorf).
* Australian federal police tracking *Realm* members *[Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahshon_Even-Chaim)*, *[Electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(computer_hacker))* and *Nom* are the first in the world to use a remote data intercept to gain evidence for a computer crime prosecution.34(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-34)
* The [Computer Misuse Act 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Misuse_Act_1990) is passed in the United Kingdom, criminalising any unauthorised access to computer systems.

 1992

* Release of the movie *[Sneakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_(1992_film))*, in which security experts are blackmailed into stealing a universal decoder for [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System).
* One of the first ISPs, [MindVox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MindVox), opens to the public.
* Bulgarian virus writer [Dark Avenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Avenger) wrote [1260](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1260_(computer_virus)), the first known use of [polymorphic code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code), used to circumvent the type of pattern recognition used by [antivirus software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software), and nowadays also [intrusion detection systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system).35(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-35)36(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-36)
* Publication of a hacking instruction manual for penetrating [TRW credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRW_Credit) reporting agency by Infinite Possibilities Society (IPS) gets Dr. Ripco, the sysop of Ripco BBS mentioned in the IPS manual, arrested by the [United States Secret Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service).37(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-ripco-37)

 1993

* The first [DEF CON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON) hacking conference takes place in [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada). The conference is meant to be a one-time party to say good-bye to BBSs (now replaced by the Web), but the gathering was so popular it became an annual event.
* [AOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL) gives its users access to [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet), precipitating [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September).

* November and December: On November 24, Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba's Cloud Security Team reported a [zero-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) vulnerability (later dubbed [Log4Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell)) involving the use of [arbitrary code execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution) in the ubiquitous [Java logging framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_logging_framework) software [Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j).203(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-lunasec-203)204(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-204)205(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Log4Shell,_Bloomberg-205) The report was privately disclosed to project developers of [Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j), a team at [The Apache Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation), on November 24. On December 8, Zhaojun contacted the developers again detailing how the vulnerability was being discussed in public security chat rooms, was already known by some security researchers, and pleaded that the team expedite the solution to the vulnerability in the official release version of [Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j).205(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Log4Shell,_Bloomberg-205) Early exploitations were noticed on Minecraft servers on December 9; however, forensic analysis indicates that Log4Shell may have been exploited as early as December 1 or 2nd.205(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Log4Shell,_Bloomberg-205)206(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Duckett2021-206)207(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Berger2021-207)208(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-208) Due to the ubiquity of devices with the [Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) software (hundreds of millions) and the simplicity in executing the vulnerability, it is considered to be arguably one of the largest and most critical vulnerabilities ever.209(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-209)210(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-210) Yet, big names in security hacking helped in regaining control over server, like [Graham Ivan Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Ivan_Clark), and Elhamy A. Elsebaey. A portion of the vulnerability was fixed in a patch distributed on December 6, three days before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed on December 9.205(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Log4Shell,_Bloomberg-205)207(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Berger2021-207)211(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-211)212(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-212)
* December: Starting from this month, [Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(hacker_group)) took notice of the [military build-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) near the [Russia-Ukraine border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia-Ukraine_border) and thus acted to propagate peace plans to end the [War in Donbass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas_(2014%E2%80%932022)) by defacing various websites, such as United Nations' Networks on Migration, [Polar Research Institute of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Research_Institute_of_China), [Convention on Biological Diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity), and various government websites in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China). The hacking collective called for a [referendum in Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendums_in_Ukraine) on whether to presumably follow the now-defunct [Minsk Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_Protocol) or hand over the separatist-controlled territories to a [UN peacekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_peacekeeping) [administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territories_governed_by_the_United_Nations). Later, a second referendum in the separatist regions would then ask voters to choose to reunite with Ukraine, gain independence, or join [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia). Besides that, they also called for the creation of a "neutral grouping" of countries "wedged between NATO and Russia" that would include [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine), [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland), [Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)), [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia), [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan), and [Moldova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldova). They argued that the so-called "neutral security belt" could serve as an alliance similar to the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization) (NATO) or the [Collective Security Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization) (CSTO) that acts as a [cordon sanitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_sanitaire_(politics)) between NATO and CSTO countries in order to "assuage Russia's fears without NATO losing its face."213(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-taiwannews.com.tw-213)214(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Anonymous_posts_'Taiwan_Numbah_Wan!-214)215(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-215)216(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Anonymous_posts_Taiwan_flag,_Peng_S-216)217(https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_security_hacking_incidents&diff=1248502272&oldid=prevcite_note-Anonymous_hacks_Chinese_site,_Russi-217)
