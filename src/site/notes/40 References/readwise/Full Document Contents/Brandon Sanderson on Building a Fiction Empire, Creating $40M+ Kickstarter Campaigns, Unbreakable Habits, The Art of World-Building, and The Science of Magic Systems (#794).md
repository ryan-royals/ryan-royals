**This episode is brought to you by [Seed’s DS-01 Daily Synbiotic](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic?utm_source=timferriss&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=25p&promo_code=25TIM)!** Seed’s [DS-01](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic?utm_source=timferriss&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=25p&promo_code=25TIM) was recommended to me months ago by a PhD microbiologist, so I started using it well before their team ever reached out to me. Since then, it’s become a daily staple and one of the few supplements I travel with. I’ve always been *highly* skeptical of most probiotics due to the lack of science and the fact that many do not survive digestion. But after incorporating two capsules of [Seed’s DS-01](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic?utm_source=timferriss&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=25p&promo_code=25TIM) into my morning routine, I have noticed improved digestion, skin tone, and overall health. Why is it so effective? For one, it’s a 2-in-1 probiotic and prebiotic formulated with 24 clinically and scientifically studied strains that have systemic benefits in and beyond the gut. **[And now, you can get 25% off your first month of DS-01 with code 25TIM](https://seed.com/daily-synbiotic?utm_source=timferriss&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=25p&promo_code=25TIM).**
