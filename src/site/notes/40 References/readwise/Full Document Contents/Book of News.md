#####  Foreword from Frank X. Shaw

Welcome everyone to Microsoft Build, our annual flagship event for developers.

The goal with the Book of News is to provide you with a roadmap to all the announcements we’re making, with all the details you need. Our focus remains the same – to make it as easy as possible for you to navigate the latest news and offer critical details on the topics you’re most interested in exploring.

Microsoft Build is an event designed for developers – showcasing tools and services that developers can use now and with an eye toward the future. With AI dominating the conversation in the technology space, it only makes sense that it plays a key role in this year’s event.

We talk about our goal to empower any developer to use any programming language, write code on any operating system and deploy applications anywhere. Now, in this new era of AI, where developers have even more choices, this continues to be our focus – democratizing our advancements in AI to help developers be more productive, providing tools and platforms to make developers’ lives easier and delivering services they can use today to create tomorrow’s intelligent apps.

This year’s Microsoft Build features a fantastic lineup of news and some exciting announcements that reflect both our commitment to the developer community and the potential of AI. I hope you will be able to join us.

Please continue to send us your feedback! We want to ensure you’re getting the information and context you need. How can we make the experience better next time?

#####  What is the Book of News?

The Microsoft Build Book of News is your guide to key news items that we are announcing at Microsoft Build. The interactive Table of Contents gives you the option to select the items you are interested in, and the translation capabilities make the Book of News more accessible globally. (Just click the Translate button below the Table of Contents to enable translations.)

We pulled together a folder of imagery related to a few of the news items. [Please take a look at the imagery here](https://aka.ms/AAktwx3). To watch keynotes and sessions related to news items, we have links below the news to get you quick access to upcoming sessions and on-demand videos. If you would like to search for AI-related news, use the Tags feature to easily sort and skim for all AI-related news items.

We hope the Book of News provides all the information, executive insight and context you need. If you have any questions or feedback regarding content in the Book of News, please email [eventcom@microsoft.com](https://aka.ms/AAktwx6).

#####  1.1.1. Microsoft is growing the AI plugin ecosystem

Microsoft is announcing that it will adopt the same open plugin standard that OpenAI introduced for ChatGPT, enabling interoperability across ChatGPT and the breadth of Microsoft’s copilot offerings.

Developers can now use one platform to build plugins that work across both consumer and business surfaces, including ChatGPT, Bing, Dynamics 365 Copilot (in preview) and Microsoft 365 Copilot (in preview). If users want to develop and use their own plugins with their AI app built on Azure OpenAI Service it will, by default, be interoperable with this same plugin standard. This means developers can build experiences that enable people to interact with their apps using the most natural user interface: the human language.

As part of this shared plugin platform, Bing is adding to its support for plugins. In addition to previously announced plugins for OpenTable and Wolfram Alpha, Microsoft also will have Expedia, Instacart, Kayak, Klarna, Redfin and Zillow, among many others, in the Bing ecosystem.

In addition to the common plugin platform, Microsoft is announcing that Bing is coming to ChatGPT as the default search experience. ChatGPT will now have a world-class search engine built in to provide more up-to-date answers with access from the web. Now, answers are grounded by search and web data and include citations so users can learn more, all directly from within chat. The new experience is rolling out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers starting today and will be available to free users soon by simply enabling a plugin.
