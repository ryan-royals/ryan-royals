Introduction

This Dromai List is one I’ve been working on together with Jamie Faulkner and Noah Clark, and it ended up getting me a record of 11-3 on PT3, bubbling out on 9th (7-1 CC, 4-2 Draft).

After very randomly stumbling across Seeker’s equipment (thanks Leon), I quickly asked Jamie and he quickly pulled to action with the endless possibilities this card opened up for Dromai. He pulled us together in a group called the Dromai Cabal to sculpt the perfect deck for Pro Tour 3

For Pro Tour 3, we predicted a spread similar to this:

* Lexi (25%)
* Oldhim (15%)
* Dromai (15%)
* Azalea (10%)
* Other (35%)

This prediction was… more or less correct. I probably overestimated Azalea a little bit, but most players seemed to recognize that taking Azalea to this field was not the best decision, despite her BH performance.

Anyway, less talking more results:

R1 - Bye (Thanks SCG for not holding a player meeting)

R2 - Lexi L

R3 - Dromai W

R4 - Azalea W

(R5 - R10 Draft 4-2)

R11 - Oldhim W   

R12 - Oldhim W   

R13 - Oldhim W   

R14 - Oldhim W (Streamed)

We’ll go over the deck, and the gameplans for the matchups in the next sections

-2x Unmovable

-3x Remembrance

-2x Tome of Fyendal (Arguable)

-1x Timesnap Potion

Strategy

* Wincons

* Win by setting up a board that Lexi cannot race
* Win by fatigue
* Win by Tomeltai

* Going second is very strong in this matchup;

* If you go first, they get to load an arrow and tend to get ahead.
* If you go second, you get to generate an ash by popping Seekers, and use your first turn to already play 4 cards out to develop dragons.

* The first 2 turns of the game will decide how the game unfolds.

* Use Wave of Reality to block out annoying on-hits, and convert that into tempo by developing your own board, and forcing them to get deal with it.
* If they got rid of it easily, consider going for the fatigue route, and wait for Tomeltai

* General tips and tricks:

* Play around Codexes; Banish AA’s with Burn Them All if your blues aren’t in grave, always keep an arsenal, play from arsenal.
* Try and deny them from getting arsenal. It’s very hard to get rid of dragons if they can only play 4 cards.
* Watch out for poppers. Passing Mirage is very often strong to develop, and makes it very safe to play strong dragons out. Ashwings very often don’t get removed and get infinite value
* Don’t spend too much ash or Sand Cover might screw you over.

Sideboarded out:   

-1x Nullrune Gloves

-1x Seeker's Leggings

-1x Wave of Reality

-3x Command and Conquer

-3x Dustup

-2x Tome of Fyendal

Strategy

* Wincons

* Win by running them out of poppers and overwhelming board
* Win by leaking damage and finishing with Ghostly Touch

* Going first vs going second is very similar. Go first if you have the choice.
* Core pieces. Prefer not blocking with these;

* Cromai
* Miragai
* Ouvia
* Rake
* Tomeltai
* Passing Mirage
* Burn Them All

* Gauge what your opponent is playing:

* Anothos Vambrace

* Very aggressive lineup.
* Don’t be afraid to gain tempo by baiting them into attacking Miragai, Cromai, Passing or Ouvia. You have 3 Remembrances for a reason.
* Don’t be afraid to block with everything that’s not a core piece for your gameplan.
* Try and set up a deck state where every turn becomes too threatening for them to go face.

* Block out with “bad” cards, play out and shuffle back Miragais with Remembrances

* Sledge

* Similar to Anothos Vambrace, but less efficient. Try and strip their hand to 1 card if Tunic isn’t up.

* Titans Fist

* Can mix up between Aggressive and Defensive, so watch out.
* Try not to arsenal DReacts, or you might get trapped into a strategy pivot.
* Ouvia is ridiculous vs Titans Fist. They need to play a popper to get rid of it usually.
* Make sure to pivot strategies along with them.

* Healing Balm Fatigue

* Can basically only go Fatigue
* Make sure to be as efficient with your dragons as possible. Develop multiple at once, get full value out of Ouvia, Cromai and Miragai by playing them as double threat

* General gameflow:

* Step 1: Go wide with Rake the Embers / Ouvia.
* Step 2: Find Tomeltai and take Crown of Seeds
* Step 3: Remembrance back copies of Rake, Ouvia, Miragai or Tomeltai
* Step 4: Find and set up Burn them all, while staying wide
* Step 5: Keep pressuring them with double threats while accruing Ghostly Touch counters
* Step 6: Remembrance back more and pressure more
* Step 7: Remembrance back finishers
* Step 8: Set up timesnaps one day
* Step 9: Finish them with Mage Master Boots Passing Ghostly Touch
* Step 10: Finish them again with Timesnap Passing Ghostly Touch

* General tips and tricks:

* Miragai combos well with a lot of cards, which makes it a prime arsenal target.
* Yendurai, Nekria, Vynserakai, Kyloria and Azvolai are generally not important for the gameplan and are completely fine to block with and often not worth taking damage for developing.
* Playing out Cromai without attacking them is a good way to buy tempo
* Remembrance targets:

* First Remembrance: Ouvia / Rake, Miragai, Tomeltai
* Second Remembrance: Ouvia / Rake, Miragai, Cromai, Passing
* Third Remembrance: Passing, Miragai, Cromai

* There’s a lot of ins and outs in this matchup that I probably missed. Play it a bunch and you’ll find out

Sideboarded out:

-1x Ghostly Touch

-1x Nullrune Gloves

-1x Seeker's Leggings (Arguable. Maybe Seekers going second?)

-3x Fate Foreseen

-3x Oasis Respite

-2x Sand Cover

-2x Unmovable

-1x Timesnap Potion

(I should probably cut 1 Passing to go down to 60)

Strategy

* Wincons

* Win by overwhelming the board
* Win by running the opponent out of Ash

* Going first vs going second feels similar. Probably go first if you can choose?
* General gameplan:

* First few turns develop ash, and hold back on making ash negative plays
* Prepare a boardclear (Rake / Azvolai) in your arsenal to clear an opposing Rake.
* Either go in when you’re in a big Ash advantage, or wait until the opponent goes in and develop your board to clear theirs.
* Keep clearing eachothers boards, until you outvalue them with your 3 Remembrances while they hopefully play less.

* General tips and tricks:

* Don’t sit on poppers for too long, your opponent won’t go face most of the times.
* Don’t take the greedy play by ignoring board. Even though it’s a tempting Tomeltai that’s waiting to kill Furnace
* Don’t be afraid to use Tome of Fyendal from hand. Most games won’t be decided by the life totals.
* Play around poppers. Getting your dragons popped before clearing their entire board is gamelosing.

-1x Ghostly Touch

-1x Mage Master Boots

-1x Nullrune Gloves

-3x Command and Conquer

-3x Dustup

-3x Remembrance

-2x Tome of Fyendal

-1x Timesnap Potion

Strategy

* Wincons

* Win by running them out of buffs
* Win by overwhelming the board

* Going first vs going second feels similar. Probably go second if you can choose
* General gameplan:

* Develop dragons for cheap, and block out as much as you can.
* Arsenal mostly DReacts

* General tips and tricks:

* Play around poppers, develop Passing if you get the chance.
* Matchup should be pretty heavily favored, since they can’t clear board efficiently, just make sure you don’t die.
