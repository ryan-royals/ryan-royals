I am pleased to introduce Microsoft’s commissioned whitepaper with IDC: [The Business Case for Responsible AI](https://aka.ms/business-case-responsible-ai). This whitepaper, based on IDC’s Worldwide Responsible AI Survey sponsored by Microsoft, offers guidance to business and technology leaders on how to systematically build trustworthy AI. In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, AI has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping industries and redefining the way businesses operate. Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024; the potential for AI to drive innovation and enhance operational efficiency is undeniable.1 However, with great power comes great responsibility. The deployment of AI technologies also brings with it significant risks and challenges that must be addressed to ensure responsible use.

At Microsoft, we are dedicated to enabling every person and organization to use and build AI that is trustworthy, which means AI that is private, safe, and secure. You can learn more about our commitments and capabilities in our [announcement about trustworthy AI](https://aka.ms/microsofttrustworthyai). Our approach to safe AI, or responsible AI, is grounded in our core values, risk management and compliance practices, advanced tools and technologies, and the dedication of individuals committed to deploying and using generative AI responsibly.

We believe that a responsible AI approach fosters innovation by ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in a manner that is fair, transparent, and accountable. IDC’s Worldwide Responsible AI Survey found that 91% of organizations are currently using AI technology and expect more than a 24% improvement in customer experience, business resilience, sustainability, and operational efficiency due to AI in 2024. In addition, organizations that use responsible AI solutions reported benefits such as improved data privacy, enhanced customer experience, confident business decisions, and strengthened brand reputation and trust. These solutions are built with tools and methodologies to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks throughout their development and deployment.

AI is a critical enabler of business transformation, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation and growth. However, the responsible development and use of AI is essential to mitigate risks and build trust with customers and stakeholders. By adopting a responsible AI approach, organizations can align AI deployment with their values and societal expectations, resulting in sustainable value for both the organization and its customers.

 Key findings from the IDC survey

The IDC Worldwide Responsible AI Survey highlights the importance of operationalizing responsible AI practices:

* More than 30% of respondents noted that the lack of governance and risk management solutions is the top barrier to adopting and scaling AI.
* More than 75% of respondents who use responsible AI solutions reported improvements in data privacy, customer experience, confident business decisions, brand reputation, and trust.
* Organizations are increasingly investing in AI and machine learning governance tools and professional services for responsible AI, with 35% of AI organization spend in 2024 allocated to AI and machine learning governance tools and 32% to professional services.

In response to these findings, IDC suggests that a responsible AI organization is built on four foundational elements: core values and governance, risk management and compliance, technologies, and workforce.

1. **Core values and governance**: A responsible AI organization defines and articulates its AI mission and principles, supported by corporate leadership. Establishing a clear governance structure across the organization builds confidence and trust in AI technologies.
2. **Risk management and compliance**: Strengthening compliance with stated principles and current laws and regulations is essential. Organizations must develop policies to mitigate risk and operationalize those policies through a risk management framework with regular reporting and monitoring.
3. **Technologies**: Utilizing tools and techniques to support principles such as fairness, explainability, robustness, accountability, and privacy is crucial. These principles must be built into AI systems and platforms.
4. **Workforce**: Empowering leadership to elevate responsible AI as a critical business imperative and providing all employees with training on responsible AI principles is paramount. Training the broader workforce ensures responsible AI adoption across the organization.

 Advice and recommendations for business and technology leaders

To ensure the responsible use of AI technologies, organizations should consider taking a systematic approach to AI governance. Based on the research, here are some recommendations for business and technology leaders. It is worth noting that Microsoft has adopted these practices and is committed to working with customers on their responsible AI journey:

1. **Establish AI principles**: Commit to developing technology responsibly and establish specific application areas that will not be pursued. Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias and build and test for safety. [Learn how Microsoft builds and governs AI responsibly](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai).
2. **Implement AI governance**: Establish an AI governance committee with diverse and inclusive representation. Define policies for governing internal and external AI use, promote transparency and explainability, and conduct regular AI audits. [Read the Microsoft Transparency Report](https://aka.ms/RAITransparencyReport2024PDF).
3. **Prioritize privacy and security**: Reinforce privacy and data protection measures in AI operations to safeguard against unauthorized data access and ensure user trust.

4. **Invest in AI training**: Allocate resources for regular training and workshops on responsible AI practices for the entire workforce, including executive leadership. [Visit Microsoft Learn and find courses on generative AI](https://aka.ms/MSLearn) for business leaders, developers, and machine learning professionals.
5. **Stay abreast of global AI regulations**: Keep up-to-date with global AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act, and ensure compliance with emerging requirements. [Stay up-to-date with requirements at Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/).

As organizations continue to integrate AI into business processes, it is important to remember that responsible AI is a strategic advantage. By embedding responsible AI practices into the core of their operations, organizations can drive innovation, enhance customer trust, and support long-term sustainability. Organizations that prioritize responsible AI may be better positioned to navigate the complexities of the AI landscape and capitalize on the opportunities it presents to reinvent the customer experience or bend the curve on innovation.

At Microsoft, we are committed to supporting our customers on their responsible AI journey. We offer a [range of tools, resources, and best practices](https://aka.ms/responsible-ai-with-azure) to help organizations implement responsible AI principles effectively. In addition, [we are leveraging our partner ecosystem](https://partnerinnovation.microsoft.com/initiatives/empowering-responsible-ai-practices-through-partners/) to provide customers with market and technical insights designed to enable deployment of responsible AI solutions on the Microsoft platform. By working together, we can create a future where AI is used responsibly benefiting both businesses and society as a whole.

As organizations navigate the complexities of AI adoption, it is important to make responsible AI an integrated practice across the organization. By doing so, organizations can harness the full potential of AI while using it in a manner that is fair and beneficial for all.
