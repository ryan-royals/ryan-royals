A fantastic fine leafed grass which makes excellent ground covers, especially around rocks and ponds, as well as plantings between stepping stones. Its low growing growth habit and sometimes wavy appearance makes it a great architectural plant.

**Minimum temperature tolerance:** Tolerates some frost once established

**Growth habit:** Low growing and spreading - spread of about 20cm per year.
