#### What’s Perimeta for Azure?

Perimeta for Azure is a unique solution that uses Azure-native tools to reduce the complexity of deploying and maintaining your cloud environment, while radically simplifying compliance and security. No matter where you are in your cloud journey, Perimeta for Azure delivers the fastest, most comprehensive, scalable, and secure platform, providing you with a common Azure foundation for building solutions and migrating workloads.

Designed specifically to align with the [**Cloud Adoption Framework**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-adoption-framework/), you and Microsoft will be speaking the same language.

Azure provides an opportunity to deliver substantial benefits and efficiencies to organisations in how they consume technology and deliver solutions to their workers and clients. Perimeta gives organisations the ability to utilise Azure services quickly and safely to help achieve business goals.

Part of the value of cloud lies in its flexibility; its ability to be whatever is needed to meet an organisation’s unique requirements. Regardless of the goals that an organisation wants to achieve, a range of security, governance, and organising structures should be put in place to help streamline activities and support a successful outcome. Perimeta for Azure provides the necessary foundational services, as well as secure, functional spaces for developers, system owners, and other technical personnel to start creating solutions and deliver real value.
