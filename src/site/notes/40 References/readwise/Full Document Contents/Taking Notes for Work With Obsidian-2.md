In this talk, I show why I think taking notes for work with Obsidian has not just helped me learn faster but improved my career working in tech as a Developer Advocate and performance engineer. I take notes continuously as a way to keep my skills relevant. This is a rehearsal of a presentation I gave [at EuroSTAR 2023](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20230614-lost-art-of-taking-good-notes).
