2023 was another great year of growing our relationships both with customers and ecosystem partners. Our list of customers around the world, including many well-known names, continued to grow, as did the stories from those customers about how working with HashiCorp addressed their most pressing infrastructure and security issues. In addition, our partner ecosystem and cooperation also expanded, as we handed out and received awards that demonstrated our commitment to working with some of the most innovative and responsive companies in the industry.

Here are some of this year’s highlights we’d like to celebrate:

##### HashiCorp now has more than 4,300 customers

Every year we are humbled and energized by the amount of trust the world’s leading companies place in our products — relying on them to run thousands of systems that millions of people use on every day (often without even noticing it). Those companies increasingly include some of the biggest, best-known firms in the world. In fact, over 200 of our more than 4,300 current customers are in the Fortune 500, and 472 are in the Global 2000. 

Even more than the numbers though, we are inspired by the stories our customers tell about how working with HashiCorp made a huge difference. Case in point: Home Depot, a Fortune 10 company, had its Director of Cloud Engineering and Enablement, Evan Wood, [join us onstage at HashiConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T28uBKTj1S4) this year to talk about Terraform and platform team enablement. 

Evan’s story was just one of many new [case studies](https://www.hashicorp.com/case-studies) and [customer sessions](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources?contentType=Case%20Study) that we shared this year. For example, [Deutsche Bank established more than 200 cloud landing zones for 3,000+ developers](https://www.hashicorp.com/case-studies/deutsche-bank) with Terraform. The Innovation Labs at telecom leader [Verizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WlUzVTgPDg) are using Boundary to provide secure MEC access to collaborate with external partners. The world’s largest job site, [Indeed.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lotQe6Gylg), uses HashiCorp Vault as a resilient, reliable platform to deliver millions of secrets every day to globally distributed workloads. HashiCorp Nomad powers [Epic Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY9crLEY_Tc)’ Fortnite creator ecosystem. And Canadian payments processor [Interac](https://www.hashicorp.com/case-studies/interac) uses HashiCorp solutions to help modernize its infrastructure and enable billions of secure, irrevocable, near real-time nationwide transactions each year.

In other important customer-related news from 2023, in July [Susan St. Ledger](https://www.hashicorp.com/about?name=susan-st.-ledger) joined HashiCorp as President, Worldwide Field Operations. With deep, successful experience at Okta, Splunk, Salesforce, and Sun Microsystems, Susan oversees all aspects of the customer journey to help maximize the value they receive from the HashiCorp product suite — from initial deployment to customer and partner success, renewal, and expansion.

##### Recognition and relationships with cloud and technology partners

Of course, we couldn’t deliver so much value to our customers without the essential contributions of our technology and cloud service providers dedicated to our mutual success. That’s why we’re so proud to have been honored with awards from a wide variety of ecosystem partners, including:

* [AWS Global Collaboration Partner of the Year award](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-at-re-invent-2023-a-year-of-collaboration-with-aws)
* [Datadog Partner Network Integration Developer Partner of the Year award](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-wins-datadog-partner-network-integration-developer-partner-year)
* [Microsoft Global OSS on Azure Partner of the Year](https://ir.hashicorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hashicorp-recognized-winner-microsoft-global-oss-azure-partner)
* [Palo Alto Networks 2023 Global Technology Partner of the Year award](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-wins-the-palo-alto-networks-2023-global-technology-partner-of-the-year)

Our collaborative development efforts with partners continue to produce valuable integrations. Last year, HashiCorp and AWS celebrated a landmark milestone — 1 billion Terraform AWS provider downloads. This year, with a major new release, the [AWS provider for Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-aws-provider-5-0-adds-updates-to-default-tags) was downloaded another billion times, surpassing 2 billion total downloads. And that’s only part of the story. In 2023, we [worked with Amazon Web Services on everything from self-service provisioning to fighting secrets sprawl](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-at-re-invent-2023-a-year-of-collaboration-with-aws) — and we were an [Emerald Sponsor of AWS re:Invent](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-at-aws-re-invent-your-blueprint-for-cloud-success). Of particular interest was the launch of [AWS Service Catalog support](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/aws-and-hashicorp-announce-service-catalog-support-for-terraform-cloud) for Terraform Community and Terraform Cloud, allowing administrators to curate a portfolio of pre-approved Terraform configurations on AWS Service Catalog. 

We also had a major new release of the [Google Cloud Terraform provider](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-google-provider-adds-updates-to-default-labels), which had two-thirds of its all-time downloads happen in 2023. These milestones underscore how the need for standardized infrastructure as code solutions is accelerating. 

We also made significant updates to the [ServiceNow Terraform Catalog](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/new-version-of-servicenow-terraform-catalog-enables-resource-updates) and introduced the [ServiceNow Service Graph Connector](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/servicenow-service-graph-connector-is-now-ga), making it easier for ServiceNow customers to provision and track infrastructure state with Terraform.

Notably, one of our key focus areas is working with partners on AI for infrastructure management. On AWS, customers can [accelerate Terraform development with Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/accelerate-your-terraform-development-with-amazon-codewhisperer). In December, HashiCorp and Google Cloud announced an [extension of our partnership](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-cloud-and-hashicorp-extend-partnership-to-advance-product-offerings-with-generative-ai-302014269.html) to advance product offerings with generative AI. And on Microsoft Azure, customers can use Azure DevOps and GitHub Copilot to [simplify and accelerate development of AI apps](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/accelerating-ai-adoption-on-azure-with-terraform).

Finally, we’d be remiss if we didn’t recognize the incredible contributions of our vibrant ecosystem of technology and systems integrator partners. In particular, we want to congratulate our [technology partner winners](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-2023-hashicorp-technology-partner-award-winners) Palo Alto Networks, Datadog, Zscaler, and Tines and all [13 regional and global systems integrator winners](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-2023-hashicorp-systems-integrator-award-winners). 

##### Looking forward to even more rewarding partnerships in 2024

We recognize the incredible responsibility of building software that underpins so much of the world’s IT infrastructure. For 2024, we’ll continue to work with our partners to build more great integrations and synergies to help our customers succeed. After all, we consider our customers partners, too, as we help them deliver great experiences to their end users. We can’t wait to see what we build together in 2024.
