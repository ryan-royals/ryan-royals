Explicit Proxy (public preview): Azure Firewall now supports [Explicit proxy mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/explicit-proxy) on the outbound path. With this mode enabled, you have the option to configure a proxy setting directly on the sending application, such as a web browser, with Azure Firewall acting as the designated proxy. This configuration allows traffic from the sending application to be directed to the private IP address of the firewall, facilitating direct egress from the firewall without the need for a UDR.
