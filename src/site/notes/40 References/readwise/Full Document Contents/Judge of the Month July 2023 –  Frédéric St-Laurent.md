**Name:** FrÃ©dÃ©ric St-Laurent

**Level:** 2

**Location:** Quebec City, Quebec

**Occupation:** Iâ€™m an IT Service Level Agreement manager for the National Assembly of Quebec (our provinceâ€™s Parliament). Iâ€™m the one responsible of setting the standards when it comes to resolving IT support requests. Iâ€™m also the one making sure that the tech support team are being provided the necessesary tools and ressources to be able to meet those standards.

**Fun Fact:** I love cooking and I make the best Oreo Cheesecake youâ€™ll ever taste.

**Favorite Hero:** As a martial artist myself (2nd dan in Kendo), itâ€™s a no brainer: Katsu.

**How long have you been judging Flesh and Blood?**  
I started during the first ProQuest season, so about a year and a half now.

**Why did you become a judge?**  
Iâ€™ve been playing MTG since 1996 and, while judging was always something I was willing to try for that game, I just preferred playing in competitive events. With Flesh and Blood, ProQuest season 1 was approaching and we really had no judges in my area. Considering the Starvo-Prism-Oldhim-Briar meta that wasnâ€™t to my liking and that I was looking for a way to give back to the FaB community, it was the perfect opportunity to finally dip my toes into judging.   
Little did I knew is how much I would have enjoyed it and and ended up diving fully into it.

**What are some tips you have for other judges?**  
When you are at a big event or working with other judges, make sure to observe what they do. There are so many things that can only really be learned in a live situation, being able to listen and watch how those experienced people approach and deals with calls, appeals, investigations, etc. is an invaluable source of knowledge. Be like a sponge and absorb as much as you can.

**How did you start playing Flesh and Blood?**  
Learned about the game from Rudy at Alpha Investments, so I decided to give it a shot once the pandemic measure started to ramp down in my area. The game really blew away my expectations.

**What is your favorite setting in the world of Rathe?**  
Mysteria. Both for its strong feudal Japan inspiration and gorgeous art direction.

**What has been your favorite Flesh and Blood event that youâ€™ve judged?**  
Pro Tour Lille â€“ My very first big event. As a newborn judge with only two ProQuests under his belt, this was very special making it there. Iâ€™ve learned so much during that event.   
Pro-Tour Baltimore â€“ From helping with coverage and running a UPF event (and oh my, this one ended up being special), to being team lead for the first time, all while working with both familiar faces and meeting new ones. This one had about a bit of everything I like about judging.

**What motivates you to continue judging?**  
I want to continue improving and become a better judge; there is still so many things I have yet to learn. Also weâ€™re having such a great community, working with you all is always a good time.

**What is your favorite non-judging memory that has happened with other judges?**  
At Pro Tour Baltimore we had the staff dinner at a Barcade and they had quite a few of my favourite games in there. Playing those games with fellow judges, even having a few rounds of Mortal Kombat against James White, definitely ranks at the top.

**What is your favorite non-Flesh and Blood hobby?**  
I have several: video games, board games, LARPing, playing Sax/Clarinet

**You were chosen to be the Judge Community Representative for Canada, what is happening in your region that you are excited about?**  
We have the Canadian Nationals are coming very soon and things are about to ramp up. There has also been a mention about a potential Calling in Canada sometime in 2024, so this is something players and judges alike are really hype about. I hope it will happen: this will be a great opportunity for local judges to get some valuable experience.

**Are there any projects or goals youâ€™re working towards with the judge community in Canada?**  
My main goal is to make sure that we have Level 2 judges available from coast to coast (weâ€™re almost there! Hoping to hear from the Maritimes soon ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png) ) so that we have a solid foundation of local ressources available for people wishing to either grow their community, have successful events or start their own judging journey.

**You have been on staff for the last two ProTours, is there any advice you have for judges looking to work events of that tier?**  
The best and most simple advice is: Be confident in your abilities and donâ€™t be affraid to apply. Sure you may not make it to the main event (especially if youâ€™re a L1) but there is usually a Calling, a Battle Hardened, side events â€” Thatâ€™s plenty of opportunities where you can enjoy the event, get experience, meet the larger Judge Community and start building relationships with TOs and other judges.
