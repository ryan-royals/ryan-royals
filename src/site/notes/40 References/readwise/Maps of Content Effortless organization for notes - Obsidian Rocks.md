> One of the biggest hurdles that you must overcome in order to take good notes is *organization*. The more notes you take, the harder it is to find things when you need them. ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvnexb5h3wb9nbqmykj4h8>))

> One concept that has been hugely beneficial for me is the idea of MOCs,  
> or *Maps of Content*. ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvnwyjvad7macccw7hwyq6>))

> Maps of Content are special notes that you can create to help organize your notes.  
> MOCs are the key to building a *digital garden*. ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvp0hdzp9k35sgbhry36vs>))

> Some say there are three different types of note-takers. They are:  
> • The architect  
> • The gardener  
> • The librarian ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvp55vwt50ggws8my7ky31>))

> The first is to keep it simple. Remember that we’re *gardening* here, our ideas can and will grow over time. Your first MOC could look no more complicated than this:
> # My First Map
> Home  
> Interests ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvpwv8f34rezevm75pb340>))

> When is the right time to create a MOC?  
> Any time you start to feel *overwhelmed* by how many notes you’re trying to juggle, create a map of content.  
> Nick Milo calls this the *mental squeeze point*. If your brain is getting overloaded, create a new MOC. It’s as simple as that. ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvqtz0gn326q5kxfseb11x>))

> If you already use Obsidian but haven’t used maps of content before, a great way to start is to [create a home note](https://obsidian.rocks/home-notes-in-obsidian-with-examples/). If you’ve never used MOCs before, I would start there, and allow your maps to grow outward from there. ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gydvr5hhtzy8vpf4ezf513j7>))
