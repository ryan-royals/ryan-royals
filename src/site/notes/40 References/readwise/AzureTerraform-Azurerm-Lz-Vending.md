## Highlights added August 30, 2024 at 2:23 PM
>The landing zone Terraform module is designed to accelerate deployment of individual landing zones within an Azure tenant. We use the [AzureRM](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest) and [AzAPI](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/azure/azapi/latest) providers to create the subscription and deploy the resources in a single `terrafom apply` step.
