> Next Action is filled with, well,the next step of whatever big project you're planning. ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy66b4p4x5s8h8m0qbfkfhv6>))

> Waiting For is for those taskswhere you are waiting on somebody to do something,so it's not something that you can progress yet,but it is like, a reminder for you to do goand chase those people if it's been too long ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy66bcrea4c25j4zjk1v9gct>))

> Some Day Maybe.This is a kind of blue sky ideawhere you think it's a cool ideabut you don't necessarily have concrete plansto do it right now,and it may not need to have a next action ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy66bnnsv5mscserg2m76nyp>))

> Now cool thing too is that you can have a person pagefor let's say Jonathan,and you can even use a Dataview queryto bring in tasks that you've markedas needing to be on the agenda ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy66d2z28ayk07e4jfect8d6>))

> For example, you can do Dataviewand then type task, from, hash tag,you can even select it here on the drop down.I'll just enter that.And when I exit out of that,it'll say that in the page meeting with Nico,I had a task that I assigned with this tag.So that's just going to be constantly updating.So on today's note on the left,I could have something that also is taggedwith Todo, agenda, Jonathan.
