## Highlights added July 17, 2024 at 11:02 AM
>PROJECTS Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now AREAS Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time RESOURCES Topics or interests that may be useful in the future ARCHIVES Inactive items from the other three categories ([Location 117] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=117))


>You have projects you’re actively working on—short-term efforts (whether in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind. For example: •  Complete webpage design •  Buy a new computer •  Write research report •  Renovate the bathroom •  Finish Spanish-language course •  Set up new living room furniture ([Location 123] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=123))


>You have areas of responsibility—important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention more broadly. These might include: •  Work responsibilities such as Marketing, Human Resources, Product Management, Research and Development, Direct Reports, or Software Development •  Personal responsibilities such as Health, Finances, Kids, Writing, Car, or Home ([Location 131] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=131))


>Then you have resources5 on a range of topics you’re interested in and learning about, such as: •  Graphic design •  Organic gardening •  Web design •  Japanese cuisine •  Photography •  Marketing assets ([Location 135] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=135))


>Finally, you have archives, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active but you might want to save for future reference: •  Projects you’ve completed or put on hold •  Areas that are no longer active or relevant •  Resources that you’re no longer interested in ([Location 142] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=142))


>Instead of organizing information according to broad subjects like in school, I advise you to organize it according to the projects and goals you are committed to right now. ([Location 169] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=169))


>Projects are “short-term efforts,” which means they need a clear end date. ([Location 216] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=216))


>OBSTACLE #1: You Can’t Truly Know the Extent of Your Commitments ([Location 221] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=221))


>What does our motivation depend on? Mostly, on making consistent progress. We can endure quite a bit of stress and frustration in the short term if we know it’s leading somewhere. ([Location 241] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=241))


>So much of what we call “organizing” is essentially procrastination in disguise. We tell ourselves we’re “getting ready” or “doing research,” pretending like that means progress. ([Location 268] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=268))


>In this chapter, I’ll walk you through the three steps I recommend you take to adopt PARA on any digital platform: •  Step 1: Archive existing files •  Step 2: Create project folders •  Step 3: Create additional folders as needed ([Location 287] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=287))


>STEP 1: Archive Existing Files ([Location 293] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=293))


>In the physical world, every piece of paper, manila file folder, and object takes up precious space. Therefore, you have to make a decision about what to do with each and every one of them, even if that decision is simply to throw it away. But the digital world is different. Digital objects don’t take up any physical space; they take up digital space, which these days is essentially unlimited. This means you never really have to throw anything away. You can keep it all. This may seem like a blessing, but in fact it’s a curse. ([Location 294] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=294))


>STEP 2: Create Project Folders ([Location 316] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=316))


>For the second step, start by creating a new folder called “Projects.” This will be the official home of all your information related to projects (short-term efforts with a clear end goal) going forward. Inside that new folder, create a subfolder for each one of your active projects and title them with the name of each project. ([Location 319] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=319))


>STEP 3: Create Additional Folders as Needed ([Location 333] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=333))


>never create an empty folder (or tag, or directory, or other container) before you have something to put in it. ([Location 342] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=342))


>TIP #1: Create an Inbox In the midst of a hectic week, you won’t usually have time to perfectly capture, title, and file away new items as they arrive. Which means you need a separate time and place to “process” new items. ([Location 370] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=370))


>I recommend creating an additional, fifth folder alongside the four we’ve already covered, on each major platform you use (such as your Documents folder, cloud storage drive, and notetaking app) with the title “Inbox.” ([Location 373] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=373))


>Number the Folders I suggest adding the numbers 0–4 at the beginning of the titles for each of the five folders you now have. Using “0” for the inbox reminds you that its contents have not yet been processed. This keeps them in the right order from most to least actionable when they are sorted alphabetically. ([Location 378] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=378))


>TIP #3: Use a Naming Convention It’s helpful if you can see a folder—on any platform, on any device—and instantly know which of the four main PARA categories it is in. I like to use an informal naming convention to make this possible, such as: •  Emojis at the beginning of titles for project folders •  Capitalized titles for area folders •  Uncapitalized titles for resource folders ([Location 385] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=385))


>The biggest misconception I see about the pivotal act of “archiving” is that you’re never going to see that information again. Don’t think of the Archive as an “idea graveyard” where information goes to die. Your archives represent the sum total of your life experience, a treasure trove of hard-won lessons and profound insights you’ve gained from both successes and failures alike. I guarantee it will contain useful material you can reuse and recycle in future endeavors. ([Location 495] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=495))


>Projects: A Goal with a Deadline My definition of a project is any endeavor that has: 1. A goal that will enable you to mark it “complete” 2. A deadline or timeframe by which you’d like it done ([Location 522] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=522))


>There are facets of your work and life that don’t have a clear end goal or deadline. We call them “areas of responsibility.” An area of responsibility has: 1. A standard to be maintained 2. An indefinite end date ([Location 532] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=532))


>However, there are a few other subtleties you should be aware of. Every project typically falls under an area of responsibility. For example: •  Running a marathon is a project, which falls under the area of Health •  Publishing a book is a project, which falls under the area of Writing •  Saving three months’ worth of expenses is a project, which falls under the area of Finances ([Location 552] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=552))


>If you have a project (such as writing a book), but you treat it like an ongoing area, without any particular goal or outcome in mind, it will feel aimless and directionless. Likewise, if you have an area (like maintaining a certain weight), but you treat it like it’s just a onetime project, then even if you succeed in losing the extra weight, you’ll likely revert right back afterward because you didn’t put in place long-term habits. ([Location 561] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=561))


>The second-most-important distinction within PARA is between Areas and Resources (the middle letters A and R). At first glance, they might seem very similar, especially considering that a given topic (such as “Nonprofit fundraising” or “Nutrition research”) could be located in either one. It depends on what that category of information means to you. ([Location 585] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=585))


>The key here is to realize that there is a big difference between things you are directly responsible for and things you are merely interested in. ([Location 592] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=592))


>Areas: The Roles You Play and the Hats You Wear Areas are parts of our lives that require ongoing attention to uphold a certain level of quality or performance. It’s helpful to think of them as the “roles you play” or the “hats you wear” at work and in life. At work, you have official roles you were hired to fulfill, such as Video Production, Legal Affairs, or Customer Service. There might also be unofficial responsibilities you’ve taken on over time, such as Company Newsletter, Mentoring, or Staff Retreats. The same is true in our personal lives. We wear different hats even throughout the course of a single day: Spouse, Parent, Soccer Coach, Neighbor, or Friend. These roles tend to be more informal, but still involve a level of responsibility for us to uphold. A folder for “Spouse” might contain notes on their favorite restaurants, ideas for gifts, or health information you might need in case of an emergency. A folder for “Soccer Coach” might contain drills, practice schedules, and a team roster with contact information. Anything you might need to reference or remember in order to effectively play these roles is worth noting down. ([Location 597] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=597))


>Interests, Curiosities, and Passions Resources encompass the vast number of things you might be interested in, curious about, or passionate about at any given time. Resources can include new skills you’re learning, such as breakdancing, photography, or golf. They could be fields or trends you’re curious about, like parenting, cryptocurrency, or artificial intelligence. Resources can also include your hobbies and passions: woodworking, bread baking, or playing the piano. ([Location 607] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=607))


>Areas Are Private Whereas Resources Are Shareable ([Location 621] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=621))


>From PROJECTS to AREAS: You might find that a training plan you used to prepare for a marathon (a project) is something you’d like to become a routine. You can create a new area folder called “Exercise” and move it there so that it remains an ongoing part of your life. ([Location 785] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=785))


>From AREAS to PROJECTS: If you decide it’s time to level up operations within your organization (which will require a onetime project), the perfect place to start is with any ideas you’ve collected in an “Operations” area folder. New projects often emerge out of existing areas of responsibility. ([Location 787] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=787))


>From AREAS to RESOURCES: Sometimes, you realize that a piece of information you initially thought was relevant only to you (such as a list of event venues in a city) could also provide value to others. Move it from areas to resources, where it will be ready to share. ([Location 790] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=790))


>From RESOURCES to AREAS: Let’s say you decide to start cooking at home more to improve your health and nutrition. A perfect way to start would be to move a few easy-to-make recipes from a “recipes” resource folder to your “Cooking” area folder. That way you can get started quickly without getting distracted by “doing more research” on the Internet. ([Location 793] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=793))


>From AREAS and RESOURCES to ARCHIVES: We’ve already discussed how projects go into the Archives when they are completed or put on hold. The same is true for areas and resources: if you lose interest in bird-watching, chess, jiu-jitsu, or motorcycle repair, there’s no need to delete all that content. Just move it to the Archives in case it ever becomes relevant again. ([Location 797] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=797))


>From ARCHIVES to PROJECTS: Imagine you want to organize a conference to establish your company’s thought leadership in a new industry. A lot of the planning and materials for conferences are similar and can be reused, provided you’ve saved them. Do a search for a professional event you’ve organized in the past, and you can move any useful materials you find there to a new project folder to reuse all that past knowledge. ([Location 800] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=800))


>I suggest creating a “PARA Playbook” for your team that includes decisions such as: •  What is our definition of a “project,” “area of responsibility,” “resource,” and “archive”? •  What needs to happen when we kick off a new project for it to be considered “active”? •  What needs to happen when a project gets completed, put on hold, or canceled (to be considered “inactive”)? •  What are the officially supported platforms on which PARA will be used? •  What are the rules, guidelines, and norms that govern how people will use PARA? •  Who will be the “PARA Champion” who oversees its implementation and makes sure the guidelines are being followed? ([Location 854] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=854))


>STEP #1: List Your Current Projects ([Location 938] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=938))


>STEP #2: Add a Goal for Each Project ([Location 950] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=950))


>Project: Visit the doctor about back pain (Goal: Back pain is resolved and I can sleep through the night without discomfort) •  Project: Plan off-site agenda for staff retreat (Goal: Team is clear about what needs to be accomplished and next steps are assigned) •  Project: Develop sales campaign with Linda (Goal: Sales campaign is approved by exec team and budget is allocated) ([Location 955] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=955))


>HABIT #1: Organize According to Outcomes One of the biggest pitfalls in organizing is to treat it as an end in itself. There’s something so satisfying about neatly arranging your workspace or designing beautiful notes that look like they belong on Instagram. There’s nothing wrong with those things if you enjoy them, but I don’t think that’s why you picked up this book. I’m willing to bet there’s something you’re committed to achieving—a result or outcome that would be meaningful for you. ([Location 1025] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=1025))


>HABIT #2: Organize Just in Time My organizing philosophy is to organize as little as possible, as late as possible, and only as much as absolutely needed. This may be a strange thing to say in a book about organizing, but organizing by itself doesn’t add value. It has no inherent worth unless it puts you in a state of mind for taking effective action. ([Location 1041] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=1041))


>HABIT #3: Keep Things Informal PARA requires precision in only one place: the definition of projects. Everything else is not only allowed to remain somewhat messy; that’s how it should be. Highly precise systems require a lot of effort to maintain, which means most aspects of your digital world should remain loose and informal by default. ([Location 1051] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=1051))


>This is why I don’t agree with a lot of the recommendations made by organizing gurus. For example, I don’t recommend: •  Creating an internal structure inside folders •  Using a standardized template for the contents of notes or documents •  Creating a hierarchy of subfolders within subfolders many levels deep •  Using databases or other formal methods for organizing personal information ([Location 1058] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=1058))


>Each habit I’ve recommended above helps create an environment where such new ideas can emerge. Organizing ideas according to outcomes ensures you’re actively testing them in the real world. Organizing just in time preserves your time and energy so you can pursue unexpected opportunities. And keeping things informal by default allows novel connections and patterns to form. ([Location 1073] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=1073))


>•  If your Documents folder becomes a digital dumpster fire, move everything into an archive with today’s date and start fresh. •  If you have tons of digital notes piled up in the inbox of your notetaking app, move them to an archive folder with today’s date and be done with it. •  If your cloud storage drive is a hot mess, move everything to a dated archive and reset for a new week, month, or year. ([Location 1156] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=1156))


>Most of us seem to have a sense of duty toward our ([Location 1179] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=1179))


>digital possessions. From a young age, your parents probably taught you to care for your belongings and treat them with respect. It almost feels like a moral obligation to meticulously upkeep our digital environment the same way we tidy our physical surroundings. ([Location 1180] (https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BZ1GNCZG&location=1180))
