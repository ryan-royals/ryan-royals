## Summary

GitHub has introduced Azure private networking for GitHub-hosted runners, enhancing enterprise security and power. This allows for secure access to private resources and enables network security policies for GitHub-hosted runners. Additionally, new runner SKUs, including GPU runners, are now available to support various use cases like machine learning and game development.
