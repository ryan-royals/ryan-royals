## Summary

The author describes the importance of finding people with information advantages, which is the ability to know something that others don't. He argues that access to people is the biggest moat that one can have in terms of information advantage. He provides examples of how this works in practice, including his own personal method for finding interesting employees in a company using LinkedIn. By focusing on people, he believes one can gain rich context and save hours of research.
