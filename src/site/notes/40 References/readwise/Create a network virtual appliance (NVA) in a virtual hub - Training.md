## Summary

Create a network virtual appliance (NVA) in a virtual hub

## Highlights added August 30, 2024 at 2:23 PM
>One of the benefits of Azure Virtual WAN is the ability to support reliable connections from many different technologies, whether Microsoft based, such as ExpressRoute or a VPN Gateway, or from a networking partner, such as Barracuda CloudGen WAN, Cisco Cloud OnRamp for Multi-Cloud, and VMware SD-WAN. These types of devices are known as network virtual appliances (NVAs); they are deployed directly into a Virtual WAN hub and have an externally facing public IP address. This capability enables customers who want to connect their branch Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to the same brand NVA in the virtual hub to take advantage of proprietary end-to-end SD-WAN capabilities. Once VNets are connected to the virtual hub, NVAs enable transitive connectivity throughout the organization's Virtual WAN.
