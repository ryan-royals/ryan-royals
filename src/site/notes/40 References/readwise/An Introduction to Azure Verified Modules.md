## Summary

Azure Verified Modules (AVM) is a project that aims to address the challenges faced by organizations when deploying resources through the portal and using infrastructure as code. AVM provides a unified strategy for infrastructure as code at Microsoft, bringing together the best of both worlds from the terraform and bicep projects. AVM offers resource modules and pattern modules, making it easier for developers and platform engineers to deploy resources and achieve their goals. The modules are supported by Microsoft and have standardized interfaces for common Azure resources, ensuring familiarity and ease of use. Customers can find more information about AVM on the AVM website, including support statements, specifications, and module indices. They can also propose new modules and contribute to the project through GitHub.
