## Highlights
`removed` block for refactoring modules: Module authors can now record in source code when a resource or module call has been removed from configuration, and can inform Terraform whether the corresponding object should be deleted or simply removed from state.
This effectively provides a configuration-driven workflow to replace `terraform state rm`. Removing an object from state is a new type of action which is planned and applied like any other. The `terraform state rm` command will remain available for scenarios in which directly modifying the state file is appropriate.
