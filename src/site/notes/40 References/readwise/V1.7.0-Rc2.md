## Summary

1.7.0-rc2 (January 11, 2024)
UPGRADE NOTES:


Input validations are being restored to the state file in this version of Terraform. Due to a state interoperability issue (#33770) in earlier versions, users that require interaction between different minor series should ensure they have upgraded to the following patches:

Users of Terraform prior to 1.3.0 are unaffected;
Terraform 1.3 series users should upgrade to 1.3.10;
Terraform 1.4 series users should upgrade to 1.4.7;
Terraform 1.5 series users should upgrade to 1.5.7;
Users of Terraform 1.6.0 and later are unaffected.

This is important for users with terraform_remote_state data sources reading remote state across different versions of Terraform.

>`removed` block for refactoring modules: Module authors can now record in source code when a resource or module call has been removed from configuration, and can inform Terraform whether the corresponding object should be deleted or simply removed from state.
>This effectively provides a configuration-driven workflow to replace `terraform state rm`. Removing an object from state is a new type of action which is planned and applied like any other. The `terraform state rm` command will remain available for scenarios in which directly modifying the state file is appropriate.
