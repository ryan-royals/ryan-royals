## Summary

Learn about endpoints when using Azure Front Door.

## Highlights added August 30, 2024 at 2:23 PM
>In Azure Front Door Standard/Premium, an *endpoint* is a logical grouping of one or more routes that are associated with domain names. Each endpoint is [assigned a domain name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/endpoint?tabs=azurecli#endpoint-domain-names) by Front Door, and you can associate your own custom domains by using routes.

>How many endpoints should I create?
>A Front Door profile can contain multiple endpoints. However, in many situations you might only need a single endpoint.
>When you're planning the endpoints to create, consider the following factors:
>• If all of your domains use the same or similar route paths, it's probably best to combine them into a single endpoint.
>• If you use different routes and route paths for each domain, consider using separate endpoints, such as by having an endpoint for each custom domain.
>• If you need to enable or disable all of your domains together, consider using a single endpoint. An entire endpoint can be enabled or disabled together. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4fw21ceagnsjq0e9e05vrat))
