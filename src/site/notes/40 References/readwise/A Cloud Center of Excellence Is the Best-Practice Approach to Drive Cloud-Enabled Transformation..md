## Summary

To ensure successful cloud adoption, organizations should set up a centralized governance function, known as a cloud center of excellence (CCOE). A CCOE sets cloud policy, guides provider selection, and assists with workload placement, with the goal of improving outcomes and managing risks. It should also raise the level of cloud knowledge in the organization, capture and disseminate best practices, and provide governance through policies and cloud management tools. CCOEs have three core pillars: governance, brokerage, and community. Other entities such as a cross-functional cloud computing advisory council and cloud communities of practice can also help drive successful cloud adoption in concert with the CCOE.
