>By default, Service Bus namespaces are accessible from internet as long as the request comes with valid authentication and authorization. With IP firewall, you can restrict it further to only a set of IPv4 addresses or IPv4 address ranges in [CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation.

>Firewalls and Virtual Networks are supported only in the **premium** tier of Service Bus. If upgrading to the **premier** tier isn't an option, we recommend that you keep the Shared Access Signature (SAS) token secure and share with only authorized users. For information about SAS authentication, see [Authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-ip-filtering/service-bus-authentication-and-authorization#shared-access-signature).
