## Summary

Azure Private DNS is a service in Microsoft Azure that provides reliable and secure DNS resolution for virtual networks. It eliminates the need for custom DNS solutions by managing and resolving domain names within the virtual network. Users can link virtual networks to private DNS zones for automatic registration of DNS records and benefit from features like split-horizon DNS support and cross-virtual network resolution.

> Azure Private DNS provides a reliable and secure DNS service for your virtual networks. Azure Private DNS manages and resolves domain names in the virtual network without the need to configure a custom DNS solution. By using private DNS zones, you can use your own custom domain name instead of the Azure-provided names during deployment. Using a custom domain name helps you tailor your virtual network architecture to best suit your organization's needs. ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01hww13z8h9e4mph3dqggagk2v>))
