## Highlights
n general, I like to categorize my setup
into the things that are for the future for the present and for the past. And I start with the future first because that's the essence of planning. Like you're looking ahead and trying to set intentions. So for me, that consists of goals, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly goals.

u might have one overarching kind of requirement that says, you know, build this site, but underneath that site there might be, you know, the homepage. And under the homepage it might be, you know get the graphic design underway. So there are different levels of requirements but there's also a best practice called requirements traceability, and that is the practice of making sure that lower level requirements all trace up to the highest one. That's just a tech way of saying that when you work
on something, you need to be making sure that it is still in line with your overall direction. And that's kind of what I like to do here. So with the core principles, I embed that into the yearly template. I'm gonna show you all of this in a second. And then the yearly into the quarterly. Quarterly into monthly. Monthly into weekly, and then weekly into the daily note. So let me show you how that works in practice. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8zzbm9psv0gwc9pzt2y93x6))
