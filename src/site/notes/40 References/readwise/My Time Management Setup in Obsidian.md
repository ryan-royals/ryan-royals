## Summary

My time management setup in Obsidian consists of a way to set goals, a daily note for rapid logging the present, and a review/retrospective system to evaluate past performance. In this video, I talk about all the plugins and apps I use to get all my responsibilities done-- without me feeling like I'm overwhelmed.

>u might have one overarching kind of requirement that says, you know, build this site, but underneath that site there might be, you know, the homepage. And under the homepage it might be, you know get the graphic design underway. So there are different levels of requirements but there's also a best practice called requirements traceability, and that is the practice of making sure that lower level requirements all trace up to the highest one. That's just a tech way of saying that when you work

Monthly into weekly, and then weekly into the daily note. So let me show you how that works in practice. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8zzbm9psv0gwc9pzt2y93x6))
