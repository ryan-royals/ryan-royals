## Summary

Azure VPN Gateway is a service that allows for encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and on-premises locations over the public internet. It can also be used to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. The service uses a specific type of virtual network gateway composed of two or more Azure-managed VMs that are automatically configured and deployed to a specific subnet called the GatewaySubnet. The VPN gateway can be used to create multiple connection configurations, including Point-to-Site, Site-to-Site, and coexisting ExpressRoute/Site-to-Site connections.

You can also use VPN Gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. Multiple connections can be created to the same VPN gateway. When you create multiple connections, all VPN tunnels share the available gateway bandwidth. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2w0e0kwt4c67x752x8kt1zv))
