## Highlights
Azure VPN Gateway is a service that uses a specific type of virtual network gateway to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and on-premises locations over the public Internet.

When you create multiple connections, all VPN tunnels share the available gateway bandwidth. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2w0e0kwt4c67x752x8kt1zv))
