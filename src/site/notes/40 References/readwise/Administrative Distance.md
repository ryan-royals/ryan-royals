## Summary

Administrative distance (AD) or route preference[1] is a number of arbitrary unit assigned to dynamic routes, static routes and directly-connected routes.

## Highlights

Router vendors typically design their routers to assign a default administrative distance to each kind of route. For example, on Cisco routers, routes issued by the [Open Shortest Path First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSPF) routing protocol have a lower default administrative distance than routes issued by the [Routing Information Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol). This is because, by default on Cisco routers, OSPF has a default administrative distance of 110 and RIP has a default administrative distance of 120. Administrative distance values can, however, usually be adjusted manually by a [network administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator).

The administrative distance (AD) value is assigned by the [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)) on a per-protocol basis. Routers, by design, should not install multiple routes into the routing table as this has the potential to cause routing loops.
