## Summary

Azure Private DNS is a service in Microsoft Azure that provides reliable and secure DNS resolution for virtual networks. It eliminates the need for custom DNS solutions by managing and resolving domain names within the virtual network. Users can link virtual networks to private DNS zones for automatic registration of DNS records and benefit from features like split-horizon DNS support and cross-virtual network resolution.
