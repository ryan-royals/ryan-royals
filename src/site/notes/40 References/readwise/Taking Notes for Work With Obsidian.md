## Highlights
o for example, I had literatureand I also had composition,
two things that were English related,but I still kept them in separate notebooks.Same thing with calculus and algebra.They were also static.These notes,and probably that's because they were analog,never changed.I never went back and added things or adjusted things.As I learned morethey were kind of just like a one and done thing.I wrote them and then I just go forward onto the notebook.
