>APIs enable digital experiences, simplify application integration, underpin new digital products, and make data and services reusable and universally accessible. ​With the proliferation and increasing dependency on APIs, organizations need to manage them as first-class assets throughout their lifecycle.​ ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1b27wgrvwta7wbt23psbkq1))


>Azure API Management helps customers meet these challenges:
>• Abstract backend architecture diversity and complexity from API consumers
>• Securely expose services hosted on and outside of Azure as APIs
>• Protect, accelerate, and observe APIs
>• Enable API discovery and consumption by internal and external users ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1b2823km017z56ex27vmkj3))


>All requests from client applications first reach the API gateway, which then forwards them to respective backend services. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1b2bns5m5y5bqnbmw9psd2a))


>With the [self-hosted gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts/self-hosted-gateway-overview), customers can deploy the API gateway to the same environments where they host their APIs, to optimize API traffic and ensure compliance with local regulations and guidelines.
