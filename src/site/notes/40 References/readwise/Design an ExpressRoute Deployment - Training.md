Azure ExpressRoute has three different circuit SKUs: [Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs), Standard, and [Premium](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs). The way you are charged for your ExpressRoute usage varies between these three SKU types.
• **Local SKU** - With Local SKU, you are automatically charged with an Unlimited data plan.
• **Standard and Premium SKU** - You can select between a Metered or an Unlimited data plan. All ingress data are free of charge except when using the Global Reach add-on. ([View Highlight] (https://read.readwise.io/read/01j31h5xcenwb8qerdyf2tj4sp))
