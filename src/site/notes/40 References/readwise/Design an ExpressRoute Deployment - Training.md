## Summary

ExpressRoute allows seamless connection between on-premises and Azure services. Design decisions for deploying an ExpressRoute circuit include choosing the right SKU based on data plan needs and cost optimization. It's important to estimate costs using the Azure pricing calculator before creating an ExpressRoute circuit to make informed design decisions.

> Azure ExpressRoute has three different circuit SKUs: [Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs), Standard, and [Premium](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs). The way you are charged for your ExpressRoute usage varies between these three SKU types.

> • **Standard and Premium SKU** - You can select between a Metered or an Unlimited data plan. All ingress data are free of charge except when using the Global Reach add-on. ([View Highlight] (<https://read.readwise.io/read/01j31h5xcenwb8qerdyf2tj4sp>))
