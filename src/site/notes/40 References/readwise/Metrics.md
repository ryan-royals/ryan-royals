## Highlights
**Router metrics** are configuration values used by a [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)) to make routing decisions. A *metric* is typically one of many fields in a [routing table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table). Router metrics help the router choose the best route among multiple feasible routes to a destination. The route will go in the direction of the gateway with the lowest metric.

A router metric is typically based on information such as [path length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_(networking)), [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)), [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)), [hop count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_count), path cost, [delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_delay), [maximum transmission unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit) (MTU), [reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking)) and communications cost.
