## Welcome

Howdy!  
Welcome to my site, please enjoy your stay.  
But if you do get bored, your welcome to reach out and say hi back to me :)  

## Demo Repo's

## Who is the Ryan

I'm a Cloud Infrastructure nerd that focuses on [[30 Slipbox/Azure\|Azure]] and hates clicking.  
Due to my constant battle to reduce my clicks per minute, I'm super deep into [[30 Slipbox/Terraform\|Terraform]] and write TF full time at [Arkahna](https://arkahna.io/)

When I'm not doing that, I'm probably playing or otherwise obsessing over a Trading Card Game, or throwing myself down a hill on my Downhill E-bike.

## So what Am I Looking at here

This is my [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)! Basically this is my personal wiki that I manage with [[30 Slipbox/Obsidian\|Obsidian]], and the [Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/).  
Overall the intent is this is a bit of a experiment in [Learning in Public](https://medium.com/my-learning-journal/why-you-should-learn-in-public-4fd3a6239549), which to me is a practise in treating you, the reader, as a rubber ducky that helps me guide the content on my notes, more than them just being a random collection of words.  
I love note taking, and I currently have 1005 Notes in my vault, with that number climbing daily. This garden is a mildly curated list of topics that I'm happy to share.

This content is as much a brain dump as anything else. Something things will lack detail, not be updated, all that compromise.  
As a general rule, anything in the vault you find is something I care about, so feel free to reach out if you have questions, or find something wrong like a missing link.
