## Welcome

Howdy!  
Welcome to my site, please enjoy your stay.

I'm a Lead (Backend) Engineer, leaning more towards the networking, infrastructure, cloud (Mostly Azure) side of backend, but I have a deep passion for programming and always slipping further into that rabbit hole every day.
I am not the sort of person that clicks in portals, so I'm all [[90_slipbox/Terraform\|Terraform]], all CLI, all automation 24/7.

Beyond professional guff, I love note taking (As seen in [[89_blog/How I take Notes\|How I take Notes]]), trading card games (Flesh and Blood is the king right now), painting minis, playing board games (Dominion is such a comfy place, but I also go deep into Kingdom Death: Monster), exercising (Running, downhill bike riding, moving heavy objects), and overusing brackets (and sometimes I think I'm funny).

If you found me, it might be at one of the conferences or meetups I have presented at, or even at [DDD Adelaide](https://www.dddadelaide.com) where I am a organiser.
