Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

You can't use Azure DNS to buy a domain name. For an annual fee, you can buy a domain name by using [App Service domains](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/manage-custom-dns-buy-domain#buy-and-map-an-app-service-domain) or a third-party domain name registrar. Your domains then can be hosted in Azure DNS for record management.
