> [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This list focuses on production-ready and experimental MCP servers that extend AI capabilities through file access, database connections, API integrations, and other contextual services.

## MCPs of Note to Me

Repo that has a heap of MCP Servers (The things that do the doing, as aposed to MCP Clients which are the chat bots the person interacts with) - [punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers: A collection of MCP servers.](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers "https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers")

**Terraform MCP** - does bugger all, but the dream is that it can print out a mermaid diagram of resources in the state file. - [nwiizo/tfmcp: 🌍 Terraform Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool - An experimental CLI tool that enables AI assistants to manage and operate Terraform environments. Supports reading Terraform configurations, analyzing plans, applying configurations, and managing state with Claude Desktop integration. ⚡️](https://github.com/nwiizo/tfmcp?tab=readme-ov-file "https://github.com/nwiizo/tfmcp?tab=readme-ov-file")  
**Azure cli MCP** - interact with azcli without constantly googling - [jdubois/azure-cli-mcp: Talk with Azure using MCP](https://github.com/jdubois/azure-cli-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file "https://github.com/jdubois/azure-cli-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file")  
**Spotify mcp** - Just to show off the madness. I dont need to 'talk to spotify' to get it to play a song - [marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server](https://github.com/marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server "https://github.com/marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server")  
**Obsidian MCP** - unconvinced that is is better than building a 'more classical' embeddings style approach around your doco. This is less about Obsidian, more about the concept of using MCP to interact with bulk kb files - [MarkusPfundstein/mcp-obsidian: MCP server that interacts with Obsidian via the Obsidian rest API community plugin](https://github.com/MarkusPfundstein/mcp-obsidian "https://github.com/markuspfundstein/mcp-obsidian")  
**Atlassian MCP** - Interact with Confluence and Jira - <https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian>
