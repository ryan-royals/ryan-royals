## Make Things Simpler

The idea is that there is 3 types of notes:[^1]

- **Fleeting Notes:** Used for capturing ideas quickly. These are put in the Inbox file in some form or another with the Seedling tag.
- **Literature / Permanent Notes:** Used to capture ideas from Text, or used to create a atomic note. These get moved into the Slip box, where they live awaiting a future me to read them. [^2]
- **Project Notes:** Used in relation to a project, and will be archived at project end. They hold little to no value for future use, and instead should be reviewed at the end of the project.

## Make This Processable

Empty notes for the sake of Empty notes do not get you anywhere. Having a years worth of Daily Notes that are just empty does not offer value for the vault. Don't hoard to just have content!

## Make it Decent

Each note should stand on its own legs, and should aim to be 200-500 words.  
More than that, it isn't a note anymore!

> Use full sentences, be concise, and as clear as possible. Each permanent note should be atomic, containing only a single idea.  
> Luhmann, using pen and paper, constrained permanent notes to a single side of an index card. Use that as a frame of reference for the length of each note.

## Use Good Names

Zettlekaisten ID is neat and all, but the File name should be one or two key words, but this is not the title of the note, and is best not being content in the note itself.

## Less Meta Data is More

- Parents (Topics)
- Type Tags (Seedling, Permanent, Project)

Other context is added to the note via linking in line to what matters.

## Don't Make Files for the sake of it

New notes work best when they link ideas or topics together. If a meeting is related to a specific project, just leave it on the project page.
