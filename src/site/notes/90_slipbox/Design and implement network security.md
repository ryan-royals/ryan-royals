Network security is the process of protecting resources from unauthorized access or attack by applying controls to network traffic, allowing only legitimate traffic/requests. Azure includes a robust networking infrastructure to support your application and service connectivity requirements.

Your security requirements might include:

- Authentication and authorization (for your application)
- Intrusion detection and response
- URL filtering
- Application access control
- DDoS protection

In this module, you will:

- Understand how to get network security recommendations with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Configure and monitor an Azure DDoS protection plan
- Implement and manage firewalls
- Implement network security groups (NSGs)1
- Implement a web application firewall (WAF) on Azure Front Door
- Configure a monitoring environment for networking
