[phw198/OutlookGoogleCalendarSync: Sync your Outlook and Google calendars (github.com)](https://github.com/phw198/OutlookGoogleCalendarSync)

Handy tool used to sync from Outlook to Gmail Calendar.  
Any built in tooling uses IMAP, and is ultra unreliable, this just works.

If you set the sync from Outlook --> Gmail as instant, Limitation is that it can only sync down from Gmail --> Outlook every 2 hours minimum.  
Otherwise can be every 15 minutes.
