IPsec is a group of protocols for securing connections between devices. IPsec helps keep data sent over public networks secure. It is often used to set up [[90_slipbox/Virtual Private Network\|VPNs]], and it works by encrypting IP packets, along with authenticating the source where the packets come from.

Within the term "IPsec," "IP" stands for "Internet Protocol" and "sec" for "secure." The Internet Protocol is the main routing protocol used on the Internet. IPsec is secure because it adds encryption and authentication to this process.
