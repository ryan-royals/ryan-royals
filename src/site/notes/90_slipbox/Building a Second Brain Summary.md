The idea of building a Second Brain is putting all the information you need, value, and could use in future into a uniquely your own personal space. This space holds information like study books, journals and sketches for new ideas.  
Having this place to digest ideas helps with:

- Making our Ideas concrete before we do anything with them
- Reveal new associations between ideas
- Incubate our ideas over time
- Sharpen our unique perspectives

In this book Forte presents a fundamentals for creating your own Second Brain which he calls **CODE**:

- **C**apture
- **O**rganize
- **D**istil
- **E**xpress

**Capture** step is a balance between capturing everything you interact with, but counteracting that with capturing things that are long term actionable. Some prompts for assessing that information is:

- Does it Inspire You?
- Is it useful?
- Is it personal?
- Is it surprising.

**Organise** starts with understanding that you don't always know why you need the information, but it needs to be discoverable. This process of knowing you need to store the information can be taxing and weigh down on the process.  
Tiago suggests that the process does not need to be complex. The first step is moving all old notes into a Archive, and start fresh. Notes can leave the Archive if they need to, but there is no need to re organise things you may not use. Beyond this, Tiago quotes [[The Cathedral Effect\|The Cathedral Effect]], saying that taking the time to organise your Digital Workspace will allow you to be more productive as you are not stressing about having a messy Digital Desk.

**Distil** is taking the Captured information, and making it more discoverable. This can be done with [[90_slipbox/Progressive Summarization\|Progressive Summarization]]. As a interesting example of this, Tiago relates this to Picasso's work.

There are a few mistakes to look out for:

- Over highlighting
- Highlighting without a purpose
- Making Highlighting Difficult

In this chapter Tiago also creates the **Campsite Rule**, which is if you touch a note, leave it better than you found it.

**Express** is the more personal step, as it depends on what you want to do with this knowledge. In the book it is mostly related to the discoverability of notes, which is proposed to be done 4 different ways.
