## Point to Site

A point-to-site VPN is a secure connection established between a single user's device and a remote network. This type of VPN allows an individual user to access the network resources of a remote location over the internet as if they were directly connected to the network's private environment.

## Site to Site

A site-to-site VPN establishes a secure and encrypted connection between two or more locations or networks over the internet. It allows these separate sites to communicate with each other as if they were on the same local network, securely sharing data and resources.
