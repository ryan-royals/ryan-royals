- The Azure Connected Machine agent is used as part of Azure Arc, which is the method to connect on-premises virtual machines to Azure Monitor.

## Last Minute Cram

Based on [AZ-700 Designing and Implement Azure Networking Study SUPER Guide!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVZYDhB_M64)

### Virtual Networking

- Availability Zones are individual Data Centers with their own power, cooling, location.  
- Azure Virtual Networks span all Availability Zones in the Region.  
- Azure Vnet is Layer 3 (Not layer 2 as it has no VLANS).  
- There is no Broadcast / multicast in Azure.  
- RFC1918 defines the private addresses we can use. 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 (/8), 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255(/12), 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 (/16)
	- You can also Not use
		- 224.0.0.0/4 (multicast)
		- 255.255.255.255/32 (broadcast)
		- 127.0.0.0/8 (loopback)
		- 169.254.0.0/16 (link-local)
		- 168.63.129.16/32 (internal dns)
- Vnets can be IPv4 or IPv4+IPv6, but not just IPv6
- IPv6 subnets are always a /64 subnet
- Smallest assignable IPv4 Subnet in Azure is a /29, which leaves 3 usable addresses.
- Subnets Reserve the first 4 addresses and the last 1 addresses (X.X.X.0, X.X.X.1,X.X.X.2, X.X.X.3, X.X.X.255 in a /24)

### Public IPs

- You can not Bring Your Own IP block
- Public IPs are tied to region
- There are two SKUs for Public IPs
	- Basic
		- Dynamic Or static
		- Open by Default
			- Have to use NSG to deny
		- No availability zone support
	- Standard
		- Static Only
		- Locked down by default
			- Have to use NSG to allow
		- Has Availability zone Support
- Typically SKU matches sku. Basic LB uses Basic IP, standard uses Standard IP.
- Public IP Prefixes are available to get a contiguous block of ip addresses.

### Virtual Network Peering

- Vnets can be peered across regions, which is called Global vnet peering
- Vnets must not overlap
- Vnets can not be peered across to sovereign clouds (Azure China)
- When using the `Virtual Network` tag in NSG's, `Virtual Network` includes peered VNets, and basically everything you could interact with via private ip including on prem networks.
- Peering's are not transitive, you need to either peer networks directly, or use a NVA

#### Gateway Transit

- `Allow Gateway Transit` on a hub network and `Use Remote Gatewway` propagates BGP routes from the hub network, and allows spokes to connect on premises.
- Each VNet can only use one remote gateway.
- `Allow forwarded traffic` allows traffic to be forwarded through the peering.

### User Defined Routes

- By default, RFC 1918 addresses are blackholed
- Route tables can only be connected to subnets in the same region

### Nat Gateway

- Need to use Standard SKU public IPs
- Linked per subnet, as long as they are in the same region
- Max 16 Ip addresses per NAT gateway
- only ipv4 public ips
- 64'000 connections per public ip via SNAT
- Can be pinned to a Zone / Region, but can not be zone redundant
- It is intelligent enough to not route established traffic through the nat gateway that was routing elsewhere.

### Azure DNS

- All DNS traffic is surfaced by 168.63.129.16

#### Private DNS Zones

- Each Virtual Network can only use a singe Private Dns Zone for Auto Registration
- Can link up to 1000 private dns zones
- Private DNS Zones are Global
- Each Zone can connect to 100 Vnets for registration
- Each Zone can connect to 1000 vnets for resolution

#### Public DNS Zones

- Have to be authoritative on the DNS zone

### Site to Site VPN

- Gateway subnet minimal is /29, recommended /27 so you can co exist s2s and express route. /29 only works with 1 service
- Basic SKu
	- Legacy, don't use
	- Policy based / static
	- 1 tunnel
	- can not co exist express route
	- can not do point to site
	- Can not change to another SKU live
- Other SKUS
	- Route based / dynamic
	- N number of tunnels
	- Express Route, Point to Site, Site to Site can co exist
	- Can optionally do BGP
	- Can do Active Active
	- Each tunnel typically maxes out at 1gbps, as it is processed by a single core
- Local Network Gateway is deployed to represent the public ip and private address of your on prem site
- If using Active Active VPN, you get 2 public ip addresses

### Point to Site VPN

- 3 types
	- OpenVPN
		- Uses TLS 443
		- Works for all clients
	- SSTP
		- Uses TLS 443
		- Windows Only
	- IKEv2
		- Mac
- Can do Cert based authentication
- Can do RADIUS authentication to use Active Directory to authenticate.
- Can use Entra ID on OpenVPN client using a Enterprise Application in Entra.
- OpenVPN and IKE are smart enough to detect a change in public IP, but SSTP is not and needs client config re downloaded.

### Express Route

- Private connection to Azure
- Microsoft does not do the last mile connectivity, your ISP connects to MS in the Peering Point / Meet Me location, and connects you to that.
- Big customers can use **Express Route Direct**, and supply their own router in the Meet me location
- **Private peering** allows you to connect to your virtual networks
	- Private peering is not encrypted, but you can use a VPN over it.
- **Microsoft peering** allows you to connect the public facing side of Azure
- ExpressRoute Gateway SKUs with AZ suffix are Availability Zone redundant.
- **Fastpath** makes it so inbound connections from onprem to Virtual Machines skip the Gateway subnet
	- Does not work across Vnet peering, uses the gateway subnet instead.
	- Does not work for Private Endpoints, uses the gateway subnet instead.
	- UDRs on the gateway subnet do not come into effect when using the fastpath.
	- Has to be the highest SKU
- Route Filters are used to advertise routes via the Microsoft Peering for things like Storage Accounts, regions public ips, basically the public side of Azure.
	- Uses BGP
	- Standard can advertise 4000 Routes
	- Premium can advertise 10 000 routes
- Express Route Standard connects to Geopolitical regions
- Express Route Premium allows you to connect to any region globally.
	- Can be used to route MS Route M365 services too.
	- Can connect to more than 10 Virtual Networks
- Metered Plans you pay for Ingress (and choose standard or premium from there), but not Egress data is included.
- UnMetered plans are way more expensive, but are all inclusive
- Local plans are when your meetme from the provider is very close to the Azure Region, and you can connect to that one exclusively.
	- Works out cheaper
- BFD can be used to auto failover if a active connection fails faster than BGP
- When using Express Route Direct, you can use MACSEC to encrypt between your router and MS router
- Express Route Global Reach can be used to make a VWAN between your on prem sites using the Microsoft global backbone (both sites need express route)

### Virtual WAN

- A VWAN can be created in a Region
- This contains a managed VNET in the background that you dont have access to directly.
- Other Normal Vnets can be connected to VWAN
- Basic SKU only allows Site to Site VPN connections.
- Standard SKU supports S2S, P2S, Express Route, Vnet Transitive, Multi vwan hub
- Customer Route Tables can be added to restrict and direct flow to overwrite the default Any to Any.
- 3rd Party NVA's can be installed in the VWAN, like Barracuda.

### Load Balancing

- Lots of different types dependant on your global vs region requirement, l7 vs l4 requirement.
- Regional
	- l4
		- *Azure Load Balancer*
		- Works based on Source / Dest <-> Ip/Port / Protocol
		- Can be Internal or External, but not both
		- SKUS;
			- Basic
				- Up to 300 backends in the same VMSS
				- Same Availability Zone only
				- Open by default.
				- No SLA
				- Free, No SLA
			- Standard
				- Costs, has SLA
				- Up to 1000 VMs / Nic / IP (containers and stuff) in the same Vnet.
				- Supports Availability zones
				- Locked down by default.
		- Works based on RUles
		- Has Health Probes
			- Basic is HTTP only
			- Standard is http or https
		- The Default balancing type is Hash
		- Can be set up to use 5, 3 or 2 tuple. for Session persistence. 5 default.
			- 5 tuple : Source iP, Dest Ip, Source Port, Dest port, Protocol
			- 3 tuple: Source IP, Dest Ip, Protocol
			- 2 tuple: Source Ip, Dest Ip
		- Nat rules can be used to selectively route traffic to a particular backend host based on incoming ip and port
			- E.G all 3389 goes to host 5
		- Standard SKU can do Outbound NAT rules for SNAT.
		- Standard SKU can use HA Ports, this allows you to evenly distribute traffic without configuring rules
		- Floating IP allows you to send the front end ip to the backend.
			- Ordinarily the backend pools see themselves as the destination. With Floating IP they see the frontend ip as the destination.
				- This needs a loopback adapter.
		- Only connects to Azure resources
	- l7
		- *Azure Application Gateway*
			- Http / Https / Http2
			- URL based routing
			- Http to Https redirection
			- ssl offload
				- receive encrypted, send unencrypted
			- cookie based affinity
			- Web Application Firewall.
			- Always has a Public Front end Ip, with a optional Private ip
				- Can not use the public IP, but it always needs to be there.
			- Listeners are configured to listen per IP and port
				- This is where you can do ssl offload
				- cert inspeciton
				- 2 types of listeners
					- Basic
						- Everything goes to particular rule no matter what fqdn
					- Multisite
						- Enables multiple listeners on the same port on the same url
						- Can filter by the FQDN, and by wildcards for subdomains
			- Rules are configured to move traffic based on url path
				- Basic rules just ship everything
				- Path based rules allow you to split traffic based on the path (something\.com/images goes to storage)
				- Can do path rewrites
				- Has HTTP settings for things like affinity, encryption
			- Can connect to Azure or on prem (as long as it has connectivity.)
			- Standard can Auto Scale
- Global
	- l4
		- Azure Global Load Balancer
			- Relatively new
			- Overall the same as regional LB
			- Not supported everywhere, mostly Central America regions
			- Does not support Internal mode, Public Only
			- No Outbound rules
			- Can not be upgraded from Regional, requires redeploy.
		- Azure Traffic Manager
			- Basically is just DNS
			- Can target non Azure resources
			- Can do DNS and Ip Addresses.
			- Different routing methods
				- Priority
					- Pick primary, otherwise pick backup
				- Weighted
					- 80% to one host, 20% to another
				- Performance
					- Pick the fastest
				- Geographic
					- Pick based on where request originates, then direct to Azure, External or Nested.
				- Multivalue.
					- Can only have ipv4//6 endpoints, and all healthily endpoints are returned to the request.
				- Subnet
					- Route based on Subnet of originator
			- It is DNS, and limited by TTL
		- L7
			- Azure Frontdoor
				- Globally available, uses Microsoft Points of Presence around the world.
				- Has WAF capabilities
					- Standard lets you do Custom WAF Rules
					- Premium has Managed WAF rules
				- Only HTTP/S/2
				- Can do Split TCP, where it acts as a man in the middle of the communication to reduce latency.
				- Can do SSL offload
				- Can do Caching
				- Premium can do Private Link

### NSGs and ASGs

- NSG can restrict on Source iP, Dest Ip, Source Port, Dest port, Protocol and **Service Tags**
- NSG is enforced at the NIC layer. The targeting at the Subnet is a management plane bonus.
- Regionally restricted to associating to the same region as the subnet.
- By default `AllowVnetInBound`, `AllowAzureLoadBalancer`, then `DenyAllInbound`
	- `AllowVnetInbound` uses the Virtual network Tag, which is everything private that Azure knows about in the vnet peerings / onprem.
- By default `AllowVnetOutbound`, `AllowInternetOutbound`, `DenyAllOutbound`
- ServiceTags are Microsoft Managed IP cidrs per service, typically per region.
- Application Security Groups are just a tag on a NIC that allows you to filter based on that. This is to work at scale outside of a Subnet.
- ASG's are regional

### Service Endpoints

- Service Endpoints allow you to add a service endpoint to a subnet for something like microsoft.storage.australiaeast, which gives you a better route to all aueast storage and allows you to filter the traffic on the storage account to that subnet.
- Only works on the subnet that has the service endpoint, and not neighbours on onprem etc.
- Uses the MS front bone

### Private Endpoints

- Private access to the service you are connecting to through the backend.
- Needs DNS to do the thing.
- Private Link service can be connected to a Standard Load balancer, that connects to your random custom service.
	- You can then do a private endpoint to the Private link.
	- This NATs which allows for IP overlap

### Azure Firewall

- /26 minimum subnet
- Premium sku adds
	- TLS inspection
	- IDPS
	- URL filtering
		- Adding capability to filter based on path
	- Web Categories
		- Stop the gambling sites
- 3 Types of rules
	- Nat rules
		- Inbound
	- Network Rules
		- Layer 4
	- Application Rules
		- Layer 7
			- Has FQDN Tags which are well known MS domains

### Networking Monitoring

- NSG FLow logs --> LAWS -- > traffic analytics
