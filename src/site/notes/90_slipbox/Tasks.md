Tasks are tracked using the Checklist plugin, which is a nice simple way to collate all the tasks based on hierarchical tags.  
Tried using some smarter plugins that modify pages on the fly with dynamic content, but found them cumbersome, and didn't offer a clean overview.

Overall I keep trying to add tasks to my vault, but it ruins the content
