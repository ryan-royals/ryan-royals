Transitive routing is a concept in networking that refers to the ability of a network to route traffic between different networks through a common intermediary network or node. This means that if network A can reach network B and network B can reach network C, then network A can reach network C through network B, assuming network B allows this kind of traffic forwarding. This principle is fundamental in the operation of the internet, where data packets are often routed through multiple intermediary networks before reaching their final destination.
