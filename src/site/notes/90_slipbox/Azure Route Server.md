Azure Route Server simplifies routing between Network Virtual Appliances and VNet.  
It allows the exchange of routing information directly through [[90_slipbox/Border Gateway Protocol\|Border Gateway Protocol]] and the Azure Software Defined Network in the [[90_slipbox/Azure Virtual Network\|Azure Virtual Network]].

Using Route Server makes it so you no longer have to manually configure [[Azure User Defined Route\|User Defined Routes]] for your VNets.
