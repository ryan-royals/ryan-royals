## Azure Machine Learning Studio

### Overview

Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web portal for machine learning solutions in Azure. It includes a wide range of features and capabilities that help data scientists prepare data, train models, publish predictive services, and monitor their usage.

AMLS is used to manage the compute used by Azure Machine Learning, to which there are 4 kinds of compute you can create.

**Compute Instances**: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.  
**Compute Clusters**: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.  
**Inference Clusters**: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.  
**Attached Compute**: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.
