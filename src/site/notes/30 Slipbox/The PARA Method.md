## The PARA Method

The PARA method is a file organization system , that has a focus on keeping files in relevant folders (or classifications if using links/tags) in a effort to make them as actionable as possible.

**Projects** are files that are the most actionable, that typically have a start date, finish by date, and deliverables.  
**Areas** are files *non shareable, private* files that you are directly responsible for, like "Non-profit fundraising" if that is your field.  
**Resources** are *shareable* files that you are interested in learning more about, but in more of a hobby fashion.  
**Archive** is where files go when they are not longer interesting or actionable.

Files can move between the top level folders and their subfolders:

> From PROJECTS to AREAS: You might find that a training plan you used to prepare for a marathon (a project) is something you’d like to become a routine. You can create a new area folder called “Exercise” and move it there so that it remains an ongoing part of your life. [^1]

> From AREAS to PROJECTS: If you decide it’s time to level up operations within your organization (which will require a onetime project), the perfect place to start is with any ideas you’ve collected in an “Operations” area folder. New projects often emerge out of existing areas of responsibility. [^1]

> From AREAS to RESOURCES: Sometimes, you realize that a piece of information you initially thought was relevant only to you (such as a list of event venues in a city) could also provide value to others. Move it from areas to resources, where it will be ready to share. [^1]

> From RESOURCES to AREAS: Let’s say you decide to start cooking at home more to improve your health and nutrition. A perfect way to start would be to move a few easy-to-make recipes from a “recipes” resource folder to your “Cooking” area folder. That way you can get started quickly without getting distracted by “doing more research” on the Internet. [^1]

> From AREAS and RESOURCES to ARCHIVES: We’ve already discussed how projects go into the Archives when they are completed or put on hold. The same is true for areas and resources: if you lose interest in bird-watching, chess, jiu-jitsu, or motorcycle repair, there’s no need to delete all that content. Just move it to the Archives in case it ever becomes relevant again. [^1]
