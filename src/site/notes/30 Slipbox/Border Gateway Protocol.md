Border Gateway Protocol is used to span routes across multiple networks, through Routers. To function, devices co ordinate traffic using a ASN (Autonomous System Number).  
Internal BGP is when routing within the same AS, whilst External BGP connects several Autonomous Systems together as permitted.
