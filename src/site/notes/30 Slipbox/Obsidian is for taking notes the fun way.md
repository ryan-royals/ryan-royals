## Obsidian is for Taking Notes the Fun way

---

### What is Obsidian

Obsidian is a note taking tool that proves that power can come from stripping features.  
At its core it is a Markdown editor, at the edges its a Markdown editor.

---

- Obsidian is free, offline, no sign up required, available on desktop and mobile OS's
- They offer a service for Syncing your *vaults* between devices (Paid service, $8 a month.)
- There is also service for Publishing files to your own website using the content from the *vault* (Paid service, $8 a month.)

### What is Obsidian Trying to Do

Obsidian is a tool used to be Second Mind, a Digital Garden, a Zettelkasten, a PKM...  
These are all fancy ways of saying: Take good notes, and you will use them.

---

### How it Does These Things

---

#### Links

Link you thinking is the primary use and power that Obsidian offers over any other PKM I have used (I have extensively used OneNote and Notion before.)

---

#### Plugins

Obsidian has a massive eco system of plugins (They just crossed 1'000).  
I use ~20 plugins... but I could stop using all of them and it would be fine.

---

##### The Cool Plugins

- Task Manager
- Confluence Sync
- Templater
- Linter
- Dataview
- Readwise Sync
- Slides

### Where it Struggles

- It is a blank canvas. You can spend *hours* setting it up and re engineering it (I have done it)
