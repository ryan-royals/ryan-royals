## Map of Contents

Small indexes, or table of contents, for particular topics, used as small hubs that lead to content or other MOCs. These should be as difficult to maintain as you want them to be. They can be fancy drawn things that use tools like Excalidraw to make them fancy, or just a simple blob of links with light headings to direct to the right content.  
The trick is that these are just a way to navigate content, and should reduce drag in Note Taking, not offer more complexity.

Within this vault [[30 Slipbox/Tags Guidance\|tag]] with a `Moc` so its easy to find later.
