## How I Process Documents

As scrolling through the internet, interesting documents are added to [[40 References/readwise/Readwise\|Readwise]] for review later, or with Highlights already done.  
The `Inbox` within [[30 Slipbox/Readwise Reader\|Readwise Reader]] is used to do final checks on the document, either to `Archive` it as it is ready for processing in the vault, or mark it as `Later` for further reading

Each document is synced with a `task` tag for further processing to turn into internal articles like this!
