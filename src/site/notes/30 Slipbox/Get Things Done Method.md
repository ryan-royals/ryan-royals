Get things Done is a simple system for managing work. There is a famous book the defines the process in great detail, but in system is effectively a re occurring task to check your backlog, and a flowchart for handling tasks themselves.

It aggressively actions items, schedules them for when they are due, or trashes it.

The system also offers a way to manage reference materials, agendas for meetings, and task for context (At Computer, At Home).
