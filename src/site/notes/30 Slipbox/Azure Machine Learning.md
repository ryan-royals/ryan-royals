## Azure Machine Learning

### Overview

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. It has the following capability:

- Automated machine learning - This feature enables non experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
- Azure Machine Learning Designer - A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.
- Data and compute management - Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale
- Pipelines - Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.

### Automated ML

Automated Machine Learning automatically tries multiple pre-processing techniques and model-training algorithms in parallel. Automated machine learning allows you to train models without extensive data science or programming knowledge. For people with a data science or programming background. it provides a way to save time and resources by automating algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning.

In Azure Machine Learning, operations that you run are called *jobs*. The job configuration provides the information needed to specify your training script, compute target, and Azure ML environment in your run configuration and run a training job.
