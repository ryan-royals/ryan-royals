**Azure Load Balancer**Â operates at [[30 Slipbox/OSI Networking Model#Layer 4 - Transport\|Layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnnection (OSI) model]]. It's the single point of contact for clients. Azure Load Balancer distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to backend pool instances. These flows are according to configured load-balancing rules and health probes. The backend pool instances can be [[30 Slipbox/Azure Virtual Machine\|Azure Virtual Machines]] or instances in a [[30 Slipbox/Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set\|Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set]].[^1]

> [!note]  
> Microsoft recommends Standard load balancer. Standalone VMs, availability sets, and virtual machine scale sets can be connected to only one SKU, never both. Load balancer and the public IP address SKU must match when you use them with public IP addresses.

> **SKUs aren't mutable; therefore, you cannot change the SKU of an existing resource.**

## Deployment Types

Azure Load Balancer can be deployed as **Public (External)** or **Internal (Private)**.

A **Public** load balancer can provide load balancing for both ingress and egress connectivity to the Internet.  
A **Private** Load balancer is load balancing private ip addresses internal to the Virtual Network and your on-premises network in a hybrid scenario.

[^2]  

## Availability Zones

Azure Load Balancer can either be **[[30 Slipbox/Zone Redundancy in Azure\|Zone Redundant or Zonal]]** . Zone Redundancy is available in the **Standard** SKU.

### Zone Redundant
